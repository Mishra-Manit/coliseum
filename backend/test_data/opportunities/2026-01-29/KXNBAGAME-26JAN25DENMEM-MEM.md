# Denver at Memphis Winner?

**Outcome**: Memphis

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES (Memphis) at 0.58 implies a 58% chance Memphis wins. Research finding: The market shows heavy liquidity (volume 210,333) with a tight spread (1¢), but public scheduling news reported the Jan 25 matchup was postponed — the likely reschedule date appears to be well after Kalshi's Feb 8 close. If the game will not be played before the contract close_time, the market's assumed resolution timeline is incorrect and the current price may not reflect the uncertainty of rescheduling/cancellation. Repricing catalyst: Official reschedule/cancellation announcement or league/team schedule update that clarifies whether the game will occur before Feb 8; as that information propagates, the market should reprice quickly. Confidence: Medium — high liquidity and tight spread create good execution; the key uncertainty is the exact reschedule timing. Sources: https://kalshi.com/market/KXNBAGAME-26JAN25DENMEM-MEM

## Research Synthesis

- Researched Questions
  - Was the Denver Nuggets at Memphis Grizzlies game scheduled for January 25, 2026 officially postponed, and what did the league/team statements say? 
  - As of January 29, 2026, has an official makeup/rescheduled date been announced for Nuggets–Grizzlies? 
  - Is there a clear, public Kalshi resolution policy (or other exchange guidance) that explains how a sports market is resolved if the underlying game is postponed and then played after the market close? 

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

The NBA announced that the Denver Nuggets at Memphis Grizzlies game scheduled for January 25, 2026 was postponed due to severe winter weather affecting the Memphis area. Multiple authoritative outlets and the league's official news release report the postponement and state that the date for the rescheduled game will be announced later. The postponement was publicly communicated on January 25, 2026. (Sources: NBA.com official notice, ESPN story, Associated Press/ABC News coverage.)

Key Drivers

- Official reschedule announcement: The single most important near-term catalyst for the market is an explicit announcement from the NBA (or teams) giving the makeup date. The league’s January 25 statement specifically said the rescheduled date would be announced later; no date was attached in that release. (Sources: NBA.com, ESPN.)

- Scheduling constraints: NBA scheduling logistics (team travel, arena availability, and existing team calendars) determine where a postponed game can be reinserted. Media coverage notes that schedules are crowded and that reschedules sometimes require fitting games into existing travel windows; outlets reporting on the Jan 25 postponements noted uncertainty about when the game could be made up. (Sources: ESPN, Sports Illustrated reporting.)

- Market structure and contract close: The Kalshi market for this event closes on 2026-02-08T20:30:00+00:00 (per opportunity data). If the NBA does not schedule the makeup game to occur and be completed before that Kalshi close_time, the exchange’s eventual resolution rule for postponed events becomes central to how the contract will be settled — i.e., whether it will be settled based on a later final result, voided, or handled by other site-specific rules. (Opportunity metadata; Kalshi market page linked in Sources.)

Counterpoints and Risks

- Evidence supporting a short reschedule window: Some reporting (primarily local and beat reporters or secondary outlets) suggested that league offices and teams work quickly to announce makeup dates, and in some postponement cases the makeup is announced within days. A few media pieces speculated about likely makeup windows (one outlet suggested Feb 19 as a possibility for some storm-postponed games), but those were explicitly speculative and not league confirmations. (Sources: talkSPORT and some local/aggregator articles—speculative.)

- Evidence of uncertainty / open risk: As of the latest authoritative reporting (January 29, 2026), no official makeup date for Denver–Memphis had been released. Multiple national outlets (NBA.com, AP/ABC, ESPN, CBS) all reported the postponement and that the date would be determined later; none report a confirmed makeup date. That leaves a genuine informational gap relevant to any market that closes before the league posts a makeup date. (Sources: NBA.com, AP/ABC, ESPN, CBS.)

- Kalshi resolution policy gap: Public, authoritative guidance from Kalshi explaining how a market is resolved if the underlying event is postponed to after a Kalshi contract close_time was not found during research. Attempts to locate a specific Kalshi help/settlement policy for postponed/cancelled sports events did not yield a definitive public policy page in the searches run; the Kalshi market page for this contract exists (linked in Sources) but did not present a visible, explicit resolution-rule excerpt that explains outcomes for games played after the contract close. Because settlement behavior is platform-specific, the absence of an explicit, easily located policy introduces material operational uncertainty about how the contract will be handled if the NBA schedules the makeup after Feb 8. (Sources: Kalshi market link; searches for Kalshi policy returned no definitive public settlement doc.)

Timeline

- Jan 25, 2026: NBA announces Nuggets–Grizzlies game scheduled for Jan 25 was postponed due to inclement weather; league statement says rescheduled date will be announced later. (Sources: NBA.com, ESPN, AP/ABC.)

- Jan 25–Jan 29, 2026: Reporting across national outlets repeats that reschedule date is TBD; speculative pieces discuss possible reschedule windows but provide no confirmed dates. (Sources: ESPN, SI, CBS, ABC.)

- Feb 8, 2026 20:30 UTC: Kalshi market close (provided in opportunity metadata). If the NBA has not announced and completed the makeup game by this time, the exchange’s resolution policy and process will determine contract settlement; no definitive Kalshi settlement policy for this exact scenario was found in public search results. (Opportunity metadata; Kalshi market page provided in Sources.)

Information Gaps

- Explicit Kalshi resolution documentation: No authoritative, easily discoverable public document was found that clearly states how Kalshi resolves outcomes when an underlying sports game is postponed to a date after a market’s close_time. This is a material gap for assessing how the market will behave if the game is not played before Feb 8. (Listed as an information gap; see Sources.)

- No confirmed rescheduled date as of Jan 29, 2026: Repeated, consistent reporting across major outlets shows the Jan 25 game was postponed and that the reschedule date was still pending as of the latest reporting available during this research. That unresolved scheduling status is the core uncertainty the Scout flagged. (Sources: NBA.com, AP/ABC, ESPN, CBS, SI.)

- Limited historical aggregate data on typical reschedule lag: Searches did not identify a concise public dataset summarizing how long the NBA typically takes to reschedule weather-postponed regular-season games (distribution of lags). Coverage provided specific recent examples and speculation but not a systematic base-rate summary suitable for precise adjustments.

Notes on evidence quality: sources (1)-(4) are league and major national outlets reporting the postponement and quoting the NBA communications line that the rescheduled date will be announced later. Sources (5) is the Kalshi market referenced in the opportunity (included because resolution behavior may be platform-specific). Source (6) and other aggregator articles include context and speculative discussion of makeup-date possibilities but are not league confirmations.

If you want, next steps I can take on this research: (a) attempt to directly contact Kalshi support or search archived Kalshi help pages for an exact settlement/resolution clause; (b) monitor NBA Communications and team official channels for any makeup-date announcement between now and Feb 8 and flag the moment an official makeup date is posted. (I did not take those steps yet because the task requested a grounded research synthesis.)

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |

| **YES** | -2% | -3% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | +1% | +2% | 0.4% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence quality: credible (NBA/ESPN/AP) on postponement, but incomplete for the key variable—whether the game occurs before Kalshi close and how postponed games resolve on-platform. With no official makeup date as of Jan 29 and unclear Kalshi policy, I conservatively discount the market’s 58% to 56% to reflect operational/resolution risk rather than team fundamentals. High liquidity and tight spreads suggest the price is fairly efficient. Resulting edge versus 58¢ is negative, yielding insufficient edge. Flags: Low confidence due to weak evidence and policy gap; insufficient edge. Confidence: Low.
