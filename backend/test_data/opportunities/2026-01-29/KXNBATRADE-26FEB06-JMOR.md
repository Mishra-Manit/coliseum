# Will Ja Morant be traded by Memphis before Feb 6, 2026

**Outcome**: Ja Morant

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market yes price = 0.31 (implied 31% chance Ja Morant is traded before Feb 6, 2026). Spread = $0.02 (2¢), Volume = 97,696 — high liquidity and narrow spread. Thesis: Multiple major outlets have reported Memphis is 'entertaining offers' and trade interest exists across several teams; given the intensity and the approaching trade deadline, the market may be underpricing the probability of a deal (potential >5% gap). Repricing catalyst: ongoing trade discussions and the Feb 5–6 NBA trade deadline will force public updates and deal announcements within the market's 4–10 day horizon. Confidence: Medium-High.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- What published reporting confirms the Memphis Grizzlies are "entertaining offers" for Ja Morant and what details do those reports provide? 
- Which teams have been publicly linked to trade interest in Ja Morant, and what level/type of offers have been described? 
- Are there contract, disciplinary, health, or roster/salary constraints (e.g., no-trade clauses, contract years, recent suspensions/injuries) that would materially affect Memphis’s ability or willingness to complete a trade before Feb 6, 2026? 
- What timeline and historical precedent exists around blockbuster trades and late-stage (within 1–2 weeks) deadline activity that could inform how likely conversations progress to a completed trade by the Feb. 5, 2026 NBA deadline? 

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

Multiple mainstream NBA outlets reported in early-to-mid January 2026 that the Memphis Grizzlies have, for the first time in Ja Morant’s tenure, begun to "entertain offers" for the two-time All-Star. Initial reporting frames these as exploratory trade discussions rather than imminent, completed offers; the coverage notes Memphis would prioritize draft picks and young players in any return and that this is the earliest indication the team has engaged other clubs about Morant. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

Key Drivers

1) Public reporting of market interest: Several outlets (ESPN, RealGM, NBC Sports syndications) attribute multiple teams showing interest — specifically naming the Sacramento Kings and Miami Heat in some wire reports — and characterize the Grizzlies’ priorities (picks/young players) as the likely backbone of a potential return package. Those reports also note that league personnel generally view Morant’s trade value as muted relative to a top-tier star because of recent availability, shooting decline, defense, and contract size. ([basketball.realgm.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/283443/Kings-Heat-Interested-In-Trading-For-Ja-Morant?utm_source=openai))

2) Contract and salary implications: Reporting documents Morant’s contract through 2027–28 (salary figures cited for 2026–27 and 2027–28) and that any acquiring team would inherit large cap charges for the next two seasons; outlets use those contract numbers explicitly when evaluating which teams could realistically make trades. Those salary obligations are material for potential suitors and for what Memphis could expect in return. ([basketball.realgm.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/283443/Kings-Heat-Interested-In-Trading-For-Ja-Morant?utm_source=openai))

3) Team incentives and asset stockpile: Reporting highlights that Memphis has amassed substantial draft capital (several first-round picks and swaps) following prior trades, which gives Memphis optionality to either retool around Morant or to trade him if a suitable package emerges. That asset position is a driver that makes entertaining offers plausible from a franchise-strategy standpoint. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

Counterpoints and Risks

1) Early-stage characterization of talks: Some league reporting frames certain team connections as "premature" or exploratory rather than substantive negotiations — for example, reporting around Miami’s involvement explicitly calls those talks preliminary and not escalated into imminent deals. That language suggests interest does not yet equal actionable offers. ([basketball.realgm.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/283467/Heat-Grizzlies-Trade-Talks-On-Heat-Characterized-As-Premature?utm_source=openai))

2) Market appetite and fit concerns: Several analysts and write-ups point out structural reasons why trade partners may be scarce: Morant’s ball-dominant playstyle, defensive shortcomings, recent games missed (injury/suspension history), and the large non-expiring salary make acquiring him a substantial commitment. Media commentary compares Morant’s potential market to other recent star trades that produced limited returns, implying that suitors may balk at Memphis’s stated demand for picks/young talent. ([nbcsports.com](https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/grizzlies-reportedly-entertaining-offers-for-ja-morant-for-first-time/?utm_source=openai))

3) No public, verifiable offer details: Across the coverage, no outlet has published a confirmed, concrete offer package accepted or on the table; most accounts cite league sources and rival executives but stop short of reporting that any team has tendered the kind of package Memphis reportedly wants. This is an evidence gap for claims that a trade is imminent. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

Timeline

- Jan 9–15, 2026: Initial reports that Memphis is "entertaining offers" and wire items naming teams (e.g., Kings, Heat) and describing the early-stage nature of talks appear across ESPN, RealGM, and other outlets. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))
- Feb 5, 2026 (3:00 p.m. ET): Official NBA trade deadline for the 2025–26 season; reporting and league trackers repeatedly cite this date as the cutoff for trades before the Feb 6, 2026 04:59:00+00:00 market close in the opportunity. Media commentary notes that most trade activity historically clusters in the two weeks up to the deadline and frequently intensifies in the final 24–48 hours. ([nba.com](https://www.nba.com/news/2025-26-nba-trade-tracker?utm_source=openai))

Historical precedent/context: The league’s public trade trackers and deadline-coverage pages show that high-profile trade activity often consolidates near the official deadline, and that deals (both small and blockbuster) have been finalized up to and on deadline day in recent seasons. That pattern establishes a plausible window in which preliminary talks reported in mid-January could become formalized offers — but it does not, by itself, confirm any particular trade will occur. ([nba.com](https://www.nba.com/news/2025-26-nba-trade-tracker?utm_source=openai))

Information Gaps

- No confirmed offer packages: I found no reliable public reporting of a concrete, completed package (players + picks) that Memphis has accepted or has on the table for Morant. Reports are sourced to league/executive contacts and characterize the conversations as exploratory in several cases. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

- Front-office quotes: There are no substantial on-the-record quotes from Memphis executives in the reporting that explicitly confirm an intent to trade Morant or to set a specific asking price; coverage relies on league sources and rival-executive perspectives. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

- Depth of interest from named suitors: While specific teams (Kings, Heat) have been named as interested in wire reporting, those same items often note the talks are preliminary and that acquiring teams may be unwilling to part with first-round picks or their best young players; thus the quality and seriousness of interest remains partially opaque. ([basketball.realgm.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/283443/Kings-Heat-Interested-In-Trading-For-Ja-Morant?utm_source=openai))

Summary (objective framing)

- Bullish (for the proposition that a trade could happen before the deadline): Multiple independent reports from major outlets indicate the Grizzlies have begun entertaining offers and that teams (e.g., Kings, Heat) have been linked to Morant; Memphis holds ample draft capital to execute a transaction; and the NBA trade deadline historically concentrates deal activity in the final weeks/days, creating a calendar window for exploratory talks to mature. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47561697/grizzlies-entertaining-ja-morant-trade-offers-sources-say?utm_source=openai))

- Bearish (against an imminent trade): Coverage repeatedly characterizes notable team links as preliminary or "premature;" Morant’s large multi-year salary, recent suspensions/injury history, and perceived decline in value complicate suitors’ willingness to assemble the high-quality young-assets-and-picks package Memphis reportedly seeks; and there are no public, verifiable reports of formal offers or an accepted package as of the latest coverage. ([basketball.realgm.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/283467/Heat-Grizzlies-Trade-Talks-On-Heat-Characterized-As-Premature?utm_source=openai))

Notes on limits and next steps

- Reporting to date establishes that exploratory trade conversations are public and that interest exists, but I found no reporting of a formal/accepted offer or front-office statement committing to trade Morant. If you want deeper granularity (e.g., team-by-team rumored packages or insider-sourced offer terms), the next step would be targeted outreach to beat reporters (Memphis, Miami, Sacramento) and monitoring league-tracker updates in the 10 days leading into the Feb. 5, 2026 deadline.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | -1% | -3% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | -1% | -1% | 0.0% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence is credible and recent (ESPN, RealGM, NBC), but diversity is moderate and reports emphasize exploratory talks with no concrete offers. Deadline clustering can accelerate deals, yet Morant’s large contract, availability/fit concerns, and muted market value reduce the chance of a near-term trade. Memphis’s leverage and lack of on-record commitment further dampen odds. With market at 31% and true probability estimated ~30%, the edge is negative. Insufficient edge; preliminary reporting and mixed signals—proceed with caution. Confidence: Medium.
