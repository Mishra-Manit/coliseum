## Research Synthesis

Research questions
- What legally counts as the Supreme Leader “leaving office,” and what are the historical base rates and precedents for such a change in Iran?
- What is Ali Khamenei’s observable status (public appearances, health signals) in mid–late January 2026, days before the market close?
- Are there near‑term political or security dynamics (domestic unrest, institutional moves) that could plausibly force a departure before February 1, 2026?

Base rates, rules, and precedents
- Under Iran’s constitution, the Supreme Leader leaves office only through death, resignation, or dismissal by the Assembly of Experts (Article 111). Temporary incapacity transfers duties to a council but does not by itself remove the Leader. The Assembly is empowered to dismiss the Leader if he loses required qualifications or becomes incapable of fulfilling duties. ([constituteproject.org](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iran_1989?utm_source=openai))
- Since 1979 there have been only two Supreme Leaders. Ruhollah Khomeini held the post from 1979 until he died on June 3, 1989; he left office by death, not removal or resignation. This offers a single historical precedent for departure. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ruhollah-Khomeini?utm_source=openai))

Current observable status of Ali Khamenei (mid–late January 2026)
- As of January 17, 2026, Reuters distributed a handout image showing Khamenei speaking during a meeting in Tehran, indicating active public duties within the last week. ([reutersconnect.com](https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/irans-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-speaks-during-a-meeting-in-tehran/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjY6bmV3c21sX1JDMjAzSkFUM0NRNg%3D%3D/?utm_source=openai))
- Major outlets reported that Khamenei delivered televised remarks around January 17 criticizing the United States over recent unrest, again signaling he is publicly active. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fc11b1082fb75fca02205f668c822751?utm_source=openai))
- Biographical references place Khamenei’s birth in 1939, making him 86 in January 2026; advanced age is a generic risk factor, but there are no credible reports in these sources of an acute health episode in the last few days. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ali-Khamenei?utm_source=openai))

Institutional landscape relevant to removal before February 1
- The body empowered to dismiss the Leader—the Assembly of Experts—was elected alongside the parliament on March 1, 2024 in elections with historically low turnout (~41%), amid extensive candidate vetting/disqualifications that favored conservatives loyal to the system. This composition and process make extraordinary action by the Assembly less likely on short notice. ([aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/voter-turnout-hits-new-low-as-conservatives-dominate-irans-parliament?utm_source=openai))
- Reporting on that election cycle underscores that conservatives maintained dominance, and moderates such as former President Hassan Rouhani were barred from re‑election to the Assembly, limiting institutional pressure for leadership change. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/5185fddef7c631d2dfcabc4b361e75e5?utm_source=openai))

Near‑term catalysts and countervailing factors (January 24 → February 1, 2026)
- Domestic unrest: International outlets describe severe protests and a harsh crackdown in late December 2025–January 2026. Khamenei’s January remarks framed the unrest as foreign‑instigated. Such turmoil raises theoretical tail risks (e.g., sudden shocks), but reporting to date shows the state reasserting control rather than elite moves to depose him. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fc11b1082fb75fca02205f668c822751?utm_source=openai))
- External context and politics: The July 2024 election of President Masoud Pezeshkian (a reform‑minded figure but ultimately subordinate to the Leader) did not alter the constitutional primacy of the Supreme Leader. In practice, executive changes have not historically precipitated an immediate leadership transition at the very top. ([feeds.bbci.co.uk](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/articles/cx824yl3ln4o?utm_source=openai))

Synthesis of evidence
- Bullish (Yes) considerations: Khamenei is 86, and Iran is experiencing extraordinary unrest and international pressure, which can create unpredictable short‑term shocks. The constitution explicitly allows for resignation or dismissal, so multiple legal pathways exist in principle. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ali-Khamenei?utm_source=openai))
- Bearish (No) considerations: The only historical departure of a Supreme Leader was via death (Khomeini, 1989). The Assembly of Experts—empowered to dismiss—was recently elected in a process that advantaged loyalists and sidelined moderates, with no public sign of convening to act against Khamenei in the coming days. Moreover, Khamenei appeared publicly and delivered remarks on or around January 17, 2026, indicating he is currently performing his role. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ruhollah-Khomeini?utm_source=openai))

Key uncertainties and what could invalidate assumptions
- Credible, corroborated reports of sudden severe illness, incapacitation, or death would immediately change the picture. Likewise, verified news of an extraordinary Assembly of Experts move to dismiss would be decisive. As of January 24, 2026, publicly available reporting cited here shows neither.

### Reasoning

Research is high-quality with credible sources showing Khamenei publicly active on Jan 17, 2026. Only one departure in 47 years provides base rate ~2.1%. With 86-year age creating tail risk but no current health crisis, institutional composition favoring loyalists, and only ~1 week remaining, true probability estimated at 3%. Market at 6% implies NEGATIVE edge (-3%) - market is OVERESTIMATING probability. No position recommended.
