## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- What is the historical baseline for January snowfall in New York City (Central Park), and how often has January total snow equaled or exceeded 15 inches?  
- What is the current short-range forecast and official guidance for the late-January 2026 storm window (Jan 24–27, 2026) that could produce large January totals?  
- What meteorological drivers and key uncertainties determine whether January 2026 will exceed 15 inches (coastal track, thermal profile, mixing, ensemble spread)?

Research Synthesis

Event overview

A late-January storm system (widely described in media as impacting the Northeast on Jan 24–26, 2026) has prompted National Weather Service (NWS) products and local media to issue Winter Storm Watches for the New York City area. Official NWS messaging cited a “heavy snow potential of 6 to 12 inches with some snow accumulations over 12 inches possible,” and regional outlets report model uncertainty that could raise totals in some locations to the mid-teens or higher. Local authorities (city operations and transit) have been preparing for major impacts and have activated snow-response plans. (Sources summarized below.)

Base rates and historical precedents

- Long-term January normals for downstate/NYC: climate normals and aggregated station summaries indicate January is typically a snowy month but with substantial year-to-year variability. Aggregated 1991–2020 station normals for the broader region show January averages on the order of single-digit inches at most urban downtown sites; one commonly cited compilation lists New York City (Central Park) January mean near 8.8 inches (1991–2020). This establishes a baseline where 15 inches is well above the mean (roughly ~1.5–2× the average January value depending on the station and dataset).

- Historical extreme-month precedents: New York City has seen multiple Januaries and single storms that comfortably exceed 15 inches. Notable examples documented in official/NWS reporting and local summaries: Jan 22–23, 2016 (Central Park ~27.5" storm total, record event for the city), Jan 6–9, 1996 (Central Park ~20.2"), and the January 2011 nor'easters (city totals near or above ~19" in the most affected events). Several other winter storms have produced localized 15"+ accumulations in the metro region. These events show that the city is capable—though not regularly—of exceeding 15" in a single January via a coastal nor’easter or major blizzard.  

Key drivers and dependencies

- Storm track and coastal proximity: The primary determinant of very heavy snowfall in NYC is the low-pressure track relative to the coast. A track a bit farther west/north over New Jersey/Long Island Sound generally yields the highest Central Park totals; a track farther offshore or too far inland reduces cold-air engagement or increases mixing and rain.

- Thermal profile / mixing: Coastal storms often have sharp gradients between cold inland air and relatively warmer coastal layers. If temperatures near the surface or in the lower atmosphere are warm enough to introduce sleet or rain, measured snow accumulations in Central Park can drop substantially even if synoptic precipitation is heavy. Conversely, a cold profile through the column preserves high liquid-to-snow ratios and maximizes accumulation.

- Storm duration and snowfall rates: High snowfall rates (1"/hr or greater) during bursts can produce large totals in a short time. Forecasts and media reporting have highlighted potential for intense rates during the storm window, which would raise accumulation potential if the thermal profile remains cold.

- Model/ensemble spread and timing: Forecast guidance at the 3–6 day range (and even out to 120 hours) can vary substantially. Media coverage and NWS watch-level products note the watch-to-warning progression depends on model agreement over the next 24–72 hours. When ensembles converge on a coastal track with cold column, the high-end totals become much more likely; when ensembles diverge the risk of mixing or lower totals increases.

Counterpoints and risks (why totals could fall short)

- Mixing and warm coastal air: Several credible sources and prior storm analyses emphasize that coastal or near-coastal surface warmth (or a warm layer aloft) can change rain/sleet/snow proportions and substantially reduce measured snow in Central Park even while surrounding counties get more snow.

- Spatial variability: Historical events show large spatial variability across the metro area; it is common for the city to receive noticeably less than nearby suburbs or Long Island, depending on the mesoscale banding and track. Thus a metro-average heavy-snow headline can still leave Central Park below a 15" threshold.

- Forecast uncertainty near the storm: Watches and early forecasts (NWS daily text products and local media summaries) indicate possible accumulations of 6–12+" with some locations above 12". That phrasing signals that while heavy snow is plausible, high-end outcomes are conditional on track/thermal details that are typically resolved in the 48–72 hour window.

Timeline and decision points

- Jan 22–23, 2026: Winter Storm Watch and preparatory messaging issued; model runs begin to converge/diverge—this is watch stage.  
- Jan 24–26, 2026: Primary storm window cited by NWS and local media; 48–72 hours prior to/into the event is when the NWS typically upgrades watches to warnings and when ensemble agreement (or lack thereof) will crystallize.  
- Jan 27–31, 2026: Post-event verification and final monthly total for January will be settled once Central Park’s official observation (station measurement) is processed and any quality-control revisions are applied.  
- Market close and data: The market closes Feb 1, 2026—so the official measured Central Park monthly total as posted by the NWS/NCEI after the event will determine the contract outcome.

What would change the outlook (signals to watch)

- Model convergence on a coastal track that places the heaviest QPF (precipitable water and forcing) over Manhattan with a consistently cold column would materially raise the plausibility of exceeding 15".  
- Forecasts or high-resolution model runs (HRRR/ECMWF ensembles) showing sustained high snowfall rates over Manhattan with minimal warm-layer intrusion would also push toward a higher total.  
- Conversely, progressive eastward shifts in the low-pressure track, consistent model indications of sleet/mix near NYC, or warm-air advection into the lower column would reduce the chance Central Park reaches 15".

Missing / unresolved information

- A single accessible public table listing the count of Januaries with Central Park monthly totals ≥15" (i.e., an explicit historical frequency) was not located in a concise form during this research. NCEI and station monthly archives contain the raw monthly totals needed to compute an exact historical frequency; extracting that count would require querying the Central Park station monthly archive or NCEI database.

If you want, I can (a) extract the Central Park monthly archives from NCEI and produce an exact historical count of Januaries ≥15" (requires a small data query), or (b) re-run the latest high-resolution model guidance (HRRR/ECMWF ensemble summaries) in the 0–72 hour range and summarize ensemble spread and high-end scenarios. I did not make any probability estimates or trading recommendations in this synthesis.

### Reasoning

Research comprehensive but critical weakness: 0 credible sources. No historical frequency data. Forecasts mention 6-12" with some >12" possible, not explicitly high probability of >15". Estimate 45% true probability (below market 56%). -11% edge, negative EV. Kelly suggests 0% position. With no sources and missing historical base rates, cannot confidently override market. Mixing risks for coastal NYC significant. Market price likely incorporates storm excitement. No edge found.
