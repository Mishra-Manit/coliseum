# Will 'The Rip' be the top US Netflix movie on Feb 2, 2026?

**Outcome**: The Rip

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: CONFIRMED: FlixPatrol's Netflix Top 10 (United States) for February 2, 2026 shows 'The Rip' at the top of the daily movie rankings for that date. Determining event: Netflix daily Top 10 (US) for Feb 2, 2026 — published Feb 2, 2026 — indicates 'The Rip' as the top movie, which directly satisfies the market's resolution condition. Official result source: FlixPatrol daily Top 10 (United States) for 2026-02-02. Remaining risks: None identified—rankings are published and not subject to appeals. Sources: https://flixpatrol.com/top10/netflix/united-states/2026-02-02/.

## Research Synthesis

### 1. Researched questions
- Did FlixPatrol record "The Rip" as the #1 Netflix movie in the United States on 2026-02-02? 
- Is the determining event (Netflix Top 10 — US for Feb 2, 2026) already published and final, or subject to later revision/appeal? 
- Is FlixPatrol an available/resolvable source for this market and are there any competing/contradictory official sources (Netflix or others) that could overturn the ranking? 
- Any recent (last 48 hours) news, corrections, or procedural events that could change the Feb 2, 2026 result?

### 2. Resolution status
- Determining event: FlixPatrol’s snapshot of the Netflix Top 10 (United States) for 2026-02-02 must show "The Rip" as the #1 Netflix movie. 
- Event status: Occurred — FlixPatrol’s Feb 2, 2026 Top 10 pages list "The Rip" as #1 for Netflix (United States) on that date. citeturn0view0
- Official source named by market/scout: FlixPatrol (daily Top 10 archive). FlixPatrol also shows a title detail page for The Rip with its Netflix chart history. citeturn0search0turn0search1

### 3. Flip risk assessment
| Risk Factor | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Pending appeals / reviews | No evidence found | No notices, takedowns, or correction banners on FlixPatrol’s Feb 2, 2026 Top 10 page or The Rip title page; no Netflix retractions located in last 48 hours. citeturn0view0turn0search0 |
| Scheduled events that could change it | Low likelihood — separate weekly updates exist | Some platforms (third‑party markets) note Netflix posts weekly Top 10 updates (e.g., an update expected on Feb 3 reflecting weekly totals), but that weekly update is a different product (weekly/aggregated list) and does not invalidate a published daily archive on Feb 2. No scheduled re-publication or appeals for Feb 2’s daily archive found. citeturn1search3turn1search4 |
| Official announcement source clarity | Medium (aggregator vs. platform) | FlixPatrol is a widely used aggregator and archive for daily Netflix Top 10 lists; Netflix itself publishes promotional and weekly/top lists (e.g., Tudum) but does not typically issue post-hoc corrections of daily historical charts. FlixPatrol is the stated resolution source in the market rationale. citeturn0search1turn1search5 |
| Recent volatility (market price) | Not assessed via public trade history | Provided YES price = 0.92 from market data; no public trade-history snapshot located to quantify short-term price swings. (Price figure is from the opportunity data.)

### 4. Risk classification
OVERALL RISK: LOW-to-MEDIUM

Explanation: The single strongest piece of evidence is FlixPatrol’s archived Top 10 page for 2026-02-02 showing "The Rip" at #1 for Netflix (US). That page is live and explicit. There is no sign of pending appeals or correction notices on FlixPatrol or Netflix in the last 48 hours. The primary residual risk is source-type risk (FlixPatrol is an independent aggregator rather than Netflix’s internal telemetry) and procedural differences between daily FlixPatrol archives and Netflix’s own weekly/summary posts (which are published on different schedules). If the market’s rule explicitly names FlixPatrol as the resolving source (as the scout’s rationale states), the observable flip risk is low. If the market resolves to a different source (e.g., Netflix’s own top10.netflix.com weekly update), a mismatch in timing/definition could introduce medium risk — evidence of this platform-level mismatch appears in third‑party market rules and documentation. citeturn0view0turn1search3

### 5. Sources
1. FlixPatrol — TOP 10 on Netflix in the United States on February 2, 2026 (page showing "The Rip" #1). citeturn0view0
2. FlixPatrol — TOP 10 on Netflix in the World on February 2, 2026 (movie list showing "The Rip" #1 in global view). citeturn0search1
3. FlixPatrol — Title page: "The Rip" (title detail / chart history). citeturn0search0
4. Netflix / Tudum article referencing The Rip’s earlier chart performance. citeturn1search5
5. Representative third‑party market pages (Polymarket examples) documenting timing of Netflix Top 10 updates and how some markets interpret weekly vs daily lists. citeturn1search3turn1search4

Summary conclusion (concise): FlixPatrol’s archived daily Top 10 for 2026-02-02 lists "The Rip" as the #1 Netflix movie in the United States and no active appeals or correction notices were found in the last 48 hours. The main remaining caution is ensuring the market’s rule actually resolves to FlixPatrol’s daily archive (versus a different Netflix/third‑party list or a weekly aggregated update). If the market’s stated resolver is FlixPatrol’s Feb 2, 2026 daily page, flip risk appears low; if the resolver is ambiguous or points to Netflix’s own weekly summary, risk is higher and should be rechecked against that source’s publication schedule.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | +0% | +0% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | -0% | -0% | 0.0% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Risk level: MEDIUM. Evidence quality is good: FlixPatrol’s archived daily page for 2026-02-02 clearly shows “The Rip” #1 in the US; no appeals/corrections noted and the event has already occurred. Residual risk stems from source-type ambiguity (FlixPatrol aggregator vs Netflix’s own weekly lists) and potential resolver mismatch; the scout indicates FlixPatrol is the intended source, which lowers flip risk but does not eliminate it. Using market price as the true probability (0.92), edge/EV compute to ~0, below the 5% minimum-edge threshold—flagging low edge. Kelly based on these inputs suggests 0%, and with MEDIUM risk we cap at ≤5% anyway. Confidence in lock is solid if FlixPatrol daily is the resolver; otherwise, re-verify.
