# Will the rate of CPI inflation be above 2.4% for the year ending in January 2026?

**Outcome**: Above 2.4%

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 48% (implies roughly even odds that YoY CPI > 2.4%). Research finding: multiple forecasting threads and analyst write-ups ahead of the January CPI release show a meaningful chance that headline and core prints could surprise modestly higher than the low-2% range because of persistent shelter/OER carry and some upside in goods/services categories; several independent forecasts cluster around the mid-2% range for YoY CPI, meaning the market's ~48% may underweight upside risks. Repricing catalyst: the BLS CPI release for January 2026 (market close 2026-02-11) — a single data print that will immediately resolve this market and is widely-traded and visible to liquidity providers. Confidence: Medium. Sources: https://www.exponential-tech.ai/post/january-2026-cpi-forecast , https://www.kkr.com/insights/flash-macro-cpi-update-january-2025 .
