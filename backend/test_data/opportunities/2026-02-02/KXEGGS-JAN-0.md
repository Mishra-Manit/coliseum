# Will egg prices rise by more than 0% in Jan 2026?

**Outcome**: above 0%

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 32% (market assigns a relatively low probability that monthly egg prices rise >0% in Jan 2026). Research finding: supply-side shocks from recurring HPAI (avian influenza) outbreaks and recent culling have driven wholesale and retail egg-price volatility; multiple market reports and industry sources in the last 1-2 months point to renewed supply tightness and upside price pressure into winter/early-year months. Repricing catalyst: USDA/industry price releases and trade press coverage over the next days (and BLS BLS CPI/food components) will force rapidly updated expectations; given concentrated buyers and visible wholesale quotes, prices can reprice fast once fresh USDA/BLS/industry briefs circulate. Confidence: Medium-High.
