# Top Global Netflix Show on Feb 16, 2026?

**Outcome**: The Lincoln Lawyer: Season 4

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED (BUY YES @ 0.93): Market is pricing YES at ~93¢ with a 3¢ spread, indicating the market expects “The Lincoln Lawyer: Season 4” to be the Top Global Netflix Show for Feb 16, 2026. Resolution source: Netflix Top 10 daily Global TV ranking for the date (as used by this Kalshi event). Risk assessment: LOW—daily ranks can still move prior to publication, but there are no formal appeal mechanisms; resolution is by the published ranking for the date and close is near. No-swing checklist: (1) strong position via pricing, (3) no formal challenges applicable, (5) clear resolution source; stable inputs are moderate but acceptable for a near-term close. Remaining risks: late-day global viewing could reshuffle the #1 position before the daily list is finalized. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/
