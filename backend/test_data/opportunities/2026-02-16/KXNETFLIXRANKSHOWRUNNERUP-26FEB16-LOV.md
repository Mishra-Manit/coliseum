# #2 US Netflix Show on Feb 16, 2026?

**Outcome**: Love is Blind: Season 10

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED (BUY NO @ 0.92): Market is pricing NO at 92¢ with a 3¢ spread, implying a strongly favored view that “Love is Blind: Season 10” will NOT finish as the #2 US Netflix show for Feb 16, 2026. Resolution source: Netflix Top 10 daily US TV ranking for the date (as used by this Kalshi event). Risk assessment: LOW—ranking outcomes can still shift until Netflix publishes/locks the day’s Top 10, but there are no formal appeals/reviews and the close is imminent. No-swing checklist: (1) price in 92–96% band, (3) no formal challenges applicable, (5) clear resolution source; stable inputs are moderate but acceptable given short time-to-close. Remaining risks: late-day viewership changes could move the #2 slot before the daily ranking finalizes. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/
