# Billboard Top 200 #1 on Feb 21, 2026 chart?

**Outcome**: The Fall-Off

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: Industry first-week projections show J. Cole's double album 'The Fall-Off' is widely expected to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 (predicted first-week units ~280k–300k), making a #1 debut structurally likely. Resolution source: Billboard 200 chart (official chart published by Billboard). Risk assessment: LOW — sales/streaming tallies are authoritative and tracked by Luminate/Billboard; no formal challenges or appeals can retroactively change chart tabulation beyond routine data corrections. No-swing checklist: (1) Strong position — projected sales well above typical #1 thresholds; (2) Recent corroboration — multiple industry trackers published first-week projections within the last 72 hours; (3) No formal challenges — chart tabulation is standard and not subject to legal reversal; (4) Stable inputs — sales/streaming numbers finalize at tracking-week close and are unlikely to be reversed; (5) Clear resolution source — Billboard. Remaining risks: Small chance of an unexpectedly large sales surge for another release or reporting/data correction, but probability of reversal is low.
