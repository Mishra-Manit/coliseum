# What will Donald Trump say during remarks to Fort Bragg Military Families?

**Outcome**: Venezuela

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: The White House scheduled President Trump to meet and speak to the Fort Bragg military families specifically to recognize the special forces involved in the Maduro capture operation — the stated purpose makes mention of Venezuela highly likely. Resolution source: official speech/recording/transcript of the Fort Bragg remarks (audio/video/transcript). Risk assessment: LOW — event is scheduled and the topic (meeting troops responsible for Maduro capture) directly ties to Venezuela; no formal appeals or reversals applicable. No-swing checklist: (1) Strong position — visit purpose explicitly tied to the Venezuela/Maduro operation; (2) Recent corroboration — multiple news outlets reported the Fort Bragg meeting scheduled for Feb 13–14; (3) No formal challenges — transcript/video is the objective record for resolution; (4) Stable inputs — the visit is fixed and remarks will be recorded; (5) Clear resolution source — official speech transcript/video. Remaining risks: Minor ambiguity in whether the speaker uses the exact word/term the market requires (interpretation risk); transcripts/videos are available for adjudication per market rules.
