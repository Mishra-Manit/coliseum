# Will more than 2300000 people be screened by the TSA on average this week?

**Outcome**: Above 2.3 million

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: Market is pricing YES at ~95% (bid/ask 93/95) with a tight 2¢ spread and solid liquidity, indicating strong consensus that the weekly average will clear 2.3M. Resolution source: TSA daily throughput totals aggregated for the week (per market’s underlying data convention). Risk assessment: LOW—inputs are stable (large national passenger volumes; averaging over a full week reduces day-to-day noise) and there is no appeals/reversal mechanism once TSA publishes the final daily counts for the week. No-swing checklist: strong position (95% pricing), stable inputs (weekly average), no formal challenges (none applicable), clear resolution source (TSA published counts). Remaining risks: A sharp, sustained disruption (major nationwide weather/FAA event) affecting multiple days before week-end could pull the average below 2.3M.
