# Will Anthropic run an ad during the Big Game 2026?

**Outcome**: Anthropic

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES=0.64 (implies ~64% chance). Research finding: Anthropic ran a multimillion-dollar brand campaign in 2025 and purchased sizable linear-TV inventory (reported by industry outlets); AI firms have been active buyers of Super Bowl/linear TV inventory and industry reporting (WSJ, Adweek, eWeek) flags AI companies as likely participants in Super Bowl LX advertising. Repricing catalyst: confirmed advertiser lists and trade reporting from Ad Age/Adweek/WSJ typically leak/appear in the days before the game (next 1–4 days), which would force a repricing if Anthropic is confirmed or formally ruled out. Confidence: Medium. Sources: https://www.wsj.com/business/media/super-bowl-lx-ads-openai-0f605795, https://www.adweek.com/creativity/anthropics-claude-makes-first-big-ad-play-to-take-on-ai-rivals/

## Research Synthesis

### Researched Questions
- Did Anthropic run a multimillion-dollar brand campaign in 2025 with linear-TV / sports placements (and did it run any Super Bowl advertising in 2025)?
- Is there public, trade-level confirmation that Anthropic has purchased or booked a Super Bowl LX (Feb 8, 2026) ad inventory for Anthropic (i.e., any confirmed 2026 Super Bowl spot)?
- What is the recent precedent for AI companies buying Super Bowl or large linear-TV inventory (industry spend and confirmed entrants)?
- How and when do trade outlets (Ad Age, Adweek, WSJ, Marketing Dive, iSpot, Campaign) typically publish advertiser confirmations or leaks ahead of the Super Bowl? What timing should be expected between now (Jan 31, 2026) and the game (Feb 8, 2026)?

## Research Synthesis

### Event overview
This market asks whether Anthropic will run an ad during Super Bowl LX (the game on Feb 8, 2026). The Scout’s thesis notes Anthropic ran a broad consumer brand campaign in 2025, that AI firms have been active TV buyers, and that industry trade reporting often leaks advertiser lists in the days before the game. The market in question closes on 2026-02-09T04:59:00+00:00 (one day after the Super Bowl). ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/18/anthropic-brand-campaign-claude/?utm_source=openai))

### Key drivers (evidence that supports the thesis)
- Anthropic ran a named, multimillion-dollar consumer brand campaign in 2025, titled “Keep thinking,” with stated placements across sports moments, streaming platforms and national print; Adweek and Axios describe the campaign as Anthropic’s first major paid brand push and note it includes sports moments and broad media placement. These reports also reference Anthropic’s prior, brief Super Bowl presence in the preceding year. ([adweek.com](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/anthropics-claude-makes-first-big-ad-play-to-take-on-ai-rivals/?utm_source=openai))

- Industry-level precedent: major AI players used the Super Bowl and other premium linear inventory in 2024–2025 (OpenAI ran a high-profile Super Bowl spot in 2025), and reporting from media outlets shows large-scale linear- and digital-TV spend by AI firms in 2025. WSJ coverage specifically frames OpenAI’s return and characterizes AI firms as active buyers of big-game inventory. Tech press also documented AI-driven creative during the 2025 Super Bowl. These precedents demonstrate both the willingness and the budgets of AI firms to participate in Big Game advertising. ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/super-bowl-lx-ads-openai-0f605795?utm_source=openai))

- Market signaling: prediction/political markets and event trackers list Anthropic as a named possibility and show nontrivial market volume/interest for an Anthropic outcome; that indicates market participants view Anthropic as a plausible entrant and that public market odds already reflect some belief in an Anthropic appearance. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/which-companies-will-run-ads-during-super-bowl-lx?utm_source=openai))

### Counterpoints and risks (evidence against the thesis)
- No authoritative trade confirmation located: searches did not turn up a definitive, public confirmation from Anthropic, NBC/Peacock, the NFL, or a media-buying agency that Anthropic has purchased a national Super Bowl LX spot for 2026. Industry trackers and trade outlets are publishing confirmed advertisers (many brands have confirmed slots), but as of the research cut (Jan 31, 2026) I did not find an explicit Anthropic booking announcement. In short: evidence of a major 2025 brand campaign is strong, but a 2026 Super Bowl buy by Anthropic is not (publicly) confirmed. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/18/anthropic-brand-campaign-claude/?utm_source=openai))

- Slot scarcity and price: Super Bowl national 30-second inventory is extremely limited and expensive; many legacy brands and returning advertisers occupy large portions of the inventory. Trade coverage and trackers show that a lot of inventory is already claimed by major advertisers (brands returning, big consumer packaged goods, auto, pharma, etc.), and streaming-only/peacock breaks and regional buys complicate who will run national linear spots. That structural friction (price + limited national slots) can keep some entrants to streaming-only or other channels even when they run big consumer campaigns elsewhere. ([marketingdive.com](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/super-bowl-60-ad-tracker-2026/803383/?utm_source=openai))

- Strategic choices: Anthropic’s 2025 campaign materials emphasize a multi-channel approach (sports moments, streamers, OOH, print), which could be executed without a national Super Bowl spot; a company can achieve large push via sport-moment buys, Peacock streaming breaks, and heavy social/creative seeding while avoiding the one-off national Super Bowl 30–60s cost. Ad strategy differences mean a big brand spend does not automatically imply a Super Bowl national ad. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/18/anthropic-brand-campaign-claude/?utm_source=openai))

### Timeline and decision points
- Current date of this research: Jan 31, 2026. Super Bowl LX: Feb 8, 2026. Market in question closes: Feb 9, 2026 (04:59 UTC). The highest-probability window for public confirmation or authoritative trade reporting is the days immediately prior to the game (late Jan through game day): trade outlets publish trackers and confirmations across late-January and early-February and often finalize full ad trackers shortly before or on the game day. Monitoring Ad Age/Adweek/WSJ/Marketing Dive/iSpot in the 1–8 Feb window is the most likely time to see explicit confirmation or definitive exclusion. ([marketingdive.com](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/super-bowl-60-ad-tracker-2026/803383/?utm_source=openai))

### Information gaps (what I could not find / limits)
- No direct confirmation from Anthropic (company statement) or from a media-buying disclosure that a national NBC/Peacock in‑game spot for Super Bowl LX has been purchased by Anthropic. Searches of trade press and advertiser trackers as of Jan 31, 2026 turned up confirmed advertisers and broad coverage of AI entrants (e.g., OpenAI), but did not show a named Anthropic national Super Bowl booking. ([marketingdive.com](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/super-bowl-60-ad-tracker-2026/803383/?utm_source=openai))

- Media-buy contracts and TV network confirmations can be confidential; absence of a public confirmation does not guarantee a lack of booking (some buys are announced late or only after spots run). This is an unresolved data gap; the most direct way to close it is monitoring the trade trackers and leaks in the days before Feb 8, 2026.

## Bottom-line factual summary (no recommendations)
- Strong, corroborated evidence that Anthropic ran a multimillion-dollar consumer brand campaign in 2025 with sports and linear/streaming placements. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/18/anthropic-brand-campaign-claude/?utm_source=openai))
- Industry precedent and reporting show AI companies (notably OpenAI) have used Super Bowl/linear TV inventory in 2024–2025 and that AI advertising spend on linear/digital TV rose in 2025. ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/super-bowl-lx-ads-openai-0f605795?utm_source=openai))
- As of this research (Jan 31, 2026) I found no authoritative public confirmation that Anthropic has a booked national Super Bowl LX ad; major trade trackers are publishing confirmed advertisers in the late-Jan/early-Feb window and should be monitored for last-minute confirmations or exclusions.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality: Credible, diverse trade sources (WSJ, Adweek, Axios) and recent reporting, but no direct confirmation for Anthropic’s 2026 Super Bowl buy. Probability drivers: Anthropic’s 2025 multimillion-dollar brand push with sports/TV placements and AI peers’ Super Bowl precedent support participation; however, national slot scarcity, high cost, and absence from current confirmed-advertiser trackers temper odds. I anchor near market but discount for missing confirmation. Catalyst risk remains: late confirmations can emerge in the coming days, but uncertainty persists. Flags: Insufficient edge at current price; mixed signals—proceed with caution. Confidence: Medium.
