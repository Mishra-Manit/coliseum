# Will Temu run an ad during the Big Game 2026?

**Outcome**: Temu

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 38% that Temu will run a Super Bowl ad. Research: Temu has a recent pattern of buying multiple Super Bowl spots (high-profile 2024/2025 buys and repeat play), and industry trackers (BusinessWire/Marketing Dive) documented Temu's heavy 2024 presence and engagement, indicating the brand is willing to spend on Big Game inventory. Catalyst: ad buy reporting, agency/brand confirmations, or ad tracking lists (Marketing Dive / BusinessWire trackers) over the next few days typically move these markets quickly; given Temu's prior behavior, the market may be underpricing repeat purchase probability. Confidence: Medium.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- Did Temu run Big Game (Super Bowl) ads in prior years (2023–2024), and what was the scale/format of those buys? 
- As of late Jan 2026, has Temu publicly confirmed or been listed in authoritative 2026 Super Bowl ad trackers or buy lists (national broadcast or streaming-only)?
- What are the key commercial and operational constraints that make a repeat Super Bowl buy more or less likely (inventory availability, cost, streaming-only options, and base-rate behavior of repeat advertisers)?
- What regulatory, legal, or reputational risks exist that could materially affect Temu’s decision or ability to run a 2026 Big Game ad?

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

This market asks whether Temu will run an ad during the Big Game (Super Bowl LX) that airs during the national broadcast/stream on Feb 8, 2026 (the user-supplied close time for market settlement is Feb 9, 2026). Historically Temu has used the Super Bowl as a high-visibility awareness channel: it ran a “Shop Like a Billionaire” ad in the 2023 game and returned with repeated airings of an animated spot in Super Bowl LVIII (Feb 2024). Those prior buys were large national broadcast placements and drew substantial public attention. (See BusinessWire, Marketing Dive, CNBC, Campaign US.)

Key Drivers (evidence that would make a 2026 Temu ad more plausible)

- Historical precedent: Temu ran Super Bowl ads in multiple prior years. Reporting documents a 2023 national spot and a larger repeat presence in Super Bowl LVIII (2024), where Temu aired the same animated creative multiple times during game-day and generated outsized social engagement. These prior buys show the company has a recent pattern of allocating Big Game budget for brand awareness. (BusinessWire; Marketing Dive; Campaign US; CNBC.)

- Brand-scaling strategy: multiple outlets noted Temu’s aggressive U.S. marketing and willingness to spend at Super Bowl price levels (industry estimates in the $6.5–$8M per 30-second range in recent years). That financial capacity and strategy are necessary preconditions for repeat buys. (BusinessWire; Campaign US; Marketing Dive.)

- Available alternative inventory: the 2026 broadcaster sold out commercial inventory early (Marketing Dive reports NBCUniversal said inventory sold out and lists many confirmed advertisers). Some advertisers run streaming-only or Peacock/streaming placements if linear slots aren’t available; that route remains an option for brands shut out of linear inventory. (Marketing Dive 2026 tracker.)

Counterpoints and Risks (evidence that weighs against a 2026 Temu ad)

- No public confirmation as of late Jan 2026: authoritative ad-tracker coverage (Marketing Dive’s Super Bowl LX tracker, updated through Jan 30, 2026) lists many brands that have confirmed national/streaming placements; Temu does not appear in that tracker’s confirmed lists as of that update. That is a direct piece of evidence against a confirmed national/stream Temu buy at that time. (Marketing Dive 2026 tracker.)

- Inventory and price pressure: networks reported Super Bowl inventory sold out early and per-30s pricing rose to the $7–8M range for 2025/2026; if inventory was purchased earlier by incumbents, late national buys become harder and more expensive. That structural constraint reduces the number of late-entry opportunities. (Marketing Dive 2026 tracker; industry coverage of price levels.)

- Regulatory and legal pressure: Temu and its parent (PDD Holdings) have faced sustained scrutiny and legal actions in the U.S. and EU (congressional inquiries regarding forced labor/UFLPA, state attorney general investigations/complaints, and other consumer/privacy lawsuits). Reporting and company filings document ongoing investigations and litigation through late 2024–2025. Such regulatory pressure, public controversy, and active litigation create reputational and practical risks that could either deter the company from a high-profile national ad or make broadcasters/partners cautious. (CNBC; Fox Business; CSIS analysis; PDD SEC filings.)

- Political/backlash risk: Temu’s prior Big Game ad generated strong negative social commentary and calls from some lawmakers to block airtime; networks may be sensitive to advertiser controversy when allocating high-profile inventory. (CNBC; Campaign US reporting.)

Timeline / Decision Points

- Historical buys: Temu’s 2023 and 2024 Super Bowl presences are documented (Feb 2023 and Feb 2024). Those establish the precedent that Temu has previously chosen to invest in the Big Game.

- Ad-tracker cadence: industry trackers (Marketing Dive, Adweek, EDO) typically roll out confirmations in December–January and update through late January and early February. Marketing Dive’s 2026 tracker (published Dec 2, 2025; updated Jan 30, 2026) listed many confirmed advertisers but did not list Temu as of Jan 30, 2026 — a near-term data point for the market. Announcements or buy confirmations that would affect this prediction market are most likely to appear in the weeks immediately preceding the game (late Jan–early Feb 2026). (Marketing Dive 2026 tracker; EDO press list.)

- Market close: The prediction market closes Feb 9, 2026 per the opportunity data; any confirmed broadcast airing during the national Big Game window before that will resolve the market in favor of YES.

Information Gaps and Limitations

- No authoritative public confirmation of any Temu buy for Super Bowl 2026 was found in major ad trackers/database updates as of Jan 30, 2026 (Marketing Dive). That leaves open the possibility of late buys, streaming-only buys, or placements not yet publicly disclosed.

- No robust public statistic was found that quantifies the exact year-to-year repeat rate for all Super Bowl advertisers (percent of advertisers who run consecutive-year buys). Coverage and industry commentary describe many repeat advertisers and provide anecdotal examples (e.g., beer brands, Oikos, Nerds), but I did not find a single definitive percentage figure in the sources searched.

- Firm-level intent: I found no Temu press release or SEC/parent-company filing specifically confirming an ad buy for the 2026 Big Game as of the latest tracker updates. That specific confirmation, if it appears publicly, is the most direct catalyst to move a market like this.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality: Medium—credible, diverse sources (Marketing Dive, CNBC, BusinessWire, SEC) but no 2026 confirmation and incomplete base-rate stats. Probability drivers: Temu’s 2023/2024 Super Bowl buys show willingness and budget, and streaming-only placements could qualify. Offsetting factors: Marketing Dive’s Jan 30, 2026 tracker excludes Temu; inventory reportedly sold out early with higher prices; plus ongoing regulatory/reputational risks could deter a high-profile buy. Net, I estimate 36% (slightly below market) to reflect those headwinds. Flags: Mixed signals and insufficient edge at current price. Confidence: Medium (~60%).
