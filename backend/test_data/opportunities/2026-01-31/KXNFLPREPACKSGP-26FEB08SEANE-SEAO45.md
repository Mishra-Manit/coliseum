# Seattle wins against New England, Seattle and New England collectively score over 45.5 points

**Outcome**: SEA wins & Over 45.5 points

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 36% for the combined SEA win + Over 45.5 outcome. Research: Seattle's QB (Sam Darnold) is carrying an oblique issue reported by the NFL; while reports say he played through it in recent games, the injury and extra rest week materially increase variance in game-script and scoring. If follow-up injury updates trend negative (limited practice, maintenance reports), the Over component is less likely and market should reprice. Catalyst: Official injury reports and practice participation updates released in the next 48–72 hours (team reports, press conferences) will be the immediate repricing trigger. Confidence: Medium.

## Research Synthesis

### Researched questions
- What is Sam Darnold’s current injury status and recent practice participation related to the oblique issue (official reports, coach comments) in the 48–72 hours after Jan 30, 2026?
- What are Seattle’s and New England’s scoring profiles (points per game, points allowed per game, recent playoff scoring) that bear on a combined total >45.5?
- Are there proximate injury or availability issues for New England’s quarterback (Drake Maye) or other key offensive contributors that could lower expected scoring?
- Venue and historical precedent: where is the game played, what are prevailing Super Bowl scoring norms (historical and recent), and are there venue/forecast factors likely to affect scoring?

## Research synthesis

### Event overview
Market: “Seattle wins & combined points >45.5” for the Seattle vs New England championship (Super Bowl LX) closing Feb 8/9, 2026. The matchup will be played at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on February 8, 2026 (market close cited Feb 9, 2026 UTC). The Scout’s catalyst is injury-report movement on Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (oblique) within the next 48–72 hours that could materially change the Over component of the market. (Game site and date confirmed by NFL/49ers/Levi’s Stadium announcements.)

### Key drivers
- QB health and practice reports (Seattle): NFL coverage reports Sam Darnold suffered an oblique issue in mid‑January but played through it in subsequent playoff games; the NFL’s article notes he “barely” practiced in the week of one playoff win but produced strong on-field numbers (e.g., 346 yards and three TDs in that game). The oblique has been discussed publicly by team staff and national reporters as a factor but not one that prevented him from playing or producing in recent playoff games. (See NFL.com piece on Darnold’s oblique and performance.)

- Team scoring profiles (regular season and playoffs): ESPN team stat pages list Seattle at roughly high-20s points per game in the 2025 regular season (Seattle regular-season scoring around mid/upper 20s PPG; postseason scoring spiked in their playoff games). New England’s 2025 regular-season scoring is also in the high-20s (ESPN lists New England ~28.8 PPG, opponents ~18.8 PPG). Combined regular-season scoring averages for the two teams are substantially above 45.5, and both teams have shown the ability to produce higher totals in playoff games. NFL team scoring tables also show both teams among the more productive scoring offenses in 2025.

- New England QB and short-term availability: AP News (Jan 30, 2026) reports that Patriots QB Drake Maye missed practice on a Friday before travel to Santa Clara due to illness and a lingering shoulder issue; coach comments framed the absence as precautionary and the team expected him to be ready. Backup reps were taken in practice. This is a short‑term availability/health note that creates some variance in the game script and scoring, but the team has publicly described Maye’s status as manageable.

- Venue/conditions and historical scoring: The game is scheduled at Levi’s Stadium (Santa Clara), an outdoor West Coast venue. Historical Super Bowl scoring trends show meaningful variation: historically the average combined Super Bowl total is often cited in the mid‑40s, while recent Super Bowls (past several seasons) have tended to be higher (some analyses note recent Super Bowls averaging mid‑50s combined points). Multiple reputable outlets note that several of the past few Super Bowls went over their totals, suggesting recent games have skewed higher than long‑run averages.

### Counterpoints and risks
- Injury/practice-designation uncertainty: While Darnold has played through the oblique and produced large outputs, limited or no practice weeks are a concrete signal teams sometimes use to manage availability. If Seahawks reports in the next 48–72 hours move to “limited” or “did not participate,” that increases uncertainty about his mobility/timing and could meaningfully alter expected offensive output. Practice-designation movement is a commonly used catalyst for market repricing.

- Single-game playoff variability: Playoff and Super Bowl games can be atypical. There are recent high-scoring Super Bowls, but there are also low-scoring outliers (e.g., Super Bowl LIII, 16 combined points). Defensive game plans, conservative playcalling, turnovers, special teams scores, or adverse in-game conditions can suppress combined scoring even when teams averaged high PPG in the regular season.

- Opposing injuries or health issues: The Patriots reported a late illness/shoulder issue for Drake Maye (AP News); if Maye were limited or unavailable, New England would use backups and that could reduce expected Patriots scoring — but current reporting frames Maye’s absence as precautionary rather than a clear impediment to starting. Similarly, any newly reported injuries to primary skill‑position players (receivers, RBs) on either side would change scoring expectations.

### Timeline / catalysts
- Immediate catalyst window: next 48–72 hours of team injury reports and practice notes (official Wednesday/Thursday injury reports and coach press conferences during Super Bowl week) are the primary near-term information events likely to cause market repricing. AP/ESPN/NFL publish practice-participation and coach quotes on those days.

- Market close: market expires when the game starts/market close timestamp provided (Feb 9, 2026 07:00:00+00:00). Any mid‑week updates (injury report, absence, limited practice) are the actionable short-term information points.

### Information gaps / limits
- Granular medical detail: Public reports describe an “oblique” issue for Darnold but do not provide team‑released medical specifics (exact grade of strain, imaging, treatment plan). No public medical report was found that quantifies expected impact on throwing mechanics.

- Practice updates since Jan 30: This synthesis captures reporting through Jan 30–31, 2026 (Darnold coverage and Maye practice miss). If further injury/practice reports are released after Jan 31, those could materially alter the assessment—no reliable post‑Jan‑31 practice designations were available at the time of this research.

- Forecasted weather for Feb 8/9: Long‑range point forecasts beyond ~7–10 days are low‑confidence; Levi’s Stadium is an outdoor venue in the Bay Area where February weather is typically mild. No definitive late‑week meteorological forecast was available in this research window; a short‑range (3–5 day) meteorological update would be needed nearer the game for meaningful weather-driven scoring impact.

Notes on evidence quality: AP, NFL.com and ESPN are primary, high‑quality sources for injury/practice and team stat data. Historical Super Bowl scoring measures come from sports‑data compendia and national media writeups; they show that long‑run averages and recent short‑run behavior can differ materially. Where medical detail is absent from public reporting, this synthesis flags that as a data gap.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | -1% | -3% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | -1% | -2% | 0.0% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence quality: credible primary sources (NFL.com, AP, ESPN) but limited recency and missing post–Jan 31 practice updates; overall medium. Base rates show both offenses in the high-20s PPG and a favorable venue, supporting Over potential; correlation helps if SEA wins. However, Darnold’s oblique with possible limited practice and Maye’s illness/shoulder add downside to scoring and game-plan volatility. Patriots’ strong defensive PPG allowed further tempers the Over. Given pending injury/practice reports, I keep the probability near market at 35%. Flags: Insufficient edge; catalyst risk; information gaps until official reports. Confidence: Medium (~60%).
