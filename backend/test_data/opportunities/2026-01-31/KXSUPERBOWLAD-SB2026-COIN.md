# Will Coinbase run an ad during the Big Game 2026?

**Outcome**: Coinbase

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 70% that Coinbase will run a Super Bowl ad. Research: Coinbase has previously run a low-production but highly effective Super Bowl spot (2022) that generated massive traffic and engagement; the company has history and appetite for Big Game marketing, which supports a high prior. Catalyst: ad-registration reports, media trackers and pre-game ad lists published in the coming days will either confirm ad buys (supporting the price) or reveal no buy (presenting a short opportunity). Confidence: Medium. Sources: https://cointelegraph.com/news/super-bowl-2022-here-s-the-scoreboard-of-crypto-ads, https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/14/crypto-currency-superbowl

## Research Synthesis

### 1) Researched questions
- Has Coinbase publicly confirmed (or is there authoritative reporting of) a purchase of Super Bowl L/X (Big Game 2026) ad time for the Coinbase brand?
- What recent advertising activity and regulatory/market signals (campaigns, regulator actions, ad‑tracking services) show Coinbase’s appetite and ability to run a Big Game TV spot in early February 2026?
- What is Coinbase’s historical precedent for Big Game advertising (execution, outcomes, and operational learnings from prior Super Bowl activity)?
- Do industry ad‑tracking services and pregame advertiser trackers list Coinbase among confirmed Super Bowl 2026 advertisers as of Jan 31, 2026?

### 2) Research synthesis

Event overview

The market asks whether Coinbase will run an ad during the Big Game (Super Bowl L/X) on Feb 9, 2026 (market close for the prediction is 2026-02-09T04:59:00+00:00). The question hinges on whether Coinbase has (or will) purchase paid national broadcast inventory for the Big Game and actually air a Coinbase ad under the Coinbase brand (not a partner or sister brand). No authoritative Coinbase press release or SEC filing explicitly confirming a U.S. Super Bowl ad buy was found in public sources as of Jan 31, 2026. citeturn7view5turn7view4

Key drivers (evidence that would support the YES outcome)

- Historical willingness and playbook: Coinbase previously ran a highly visible Super Bowl spot in 2022 (a minute‑long QR code creative) that produced extremely large traffic and engagement — the ad crashed/overwhelmed Coinbase’s infrastructure and produced strong earned media. That demonstrates the company has precedent and an operational model for Big Game investment and conversion tactics (QR + direct signup incentives). citeturn0search0turn0search2

- Active advertising / high‑profile campaigns in 2025–Jan 2026: Coinbase has run recent mass campaigns (for example the controversial “Everything Is Fine” creative) and is active in paid media internationally; UK regulators (Clearcast/ASA) recently refused or restricted parts of that campaign, indicating Coinbase is running large promotional pushes in late 2025 / early 2026. That shows the company currently has active marketing initiatives and willingness to spend on broad reach. citeturn7view1

- Strategic incentives to advertise on a national tentpole: Big Game slots remain high‑impact opportunities where a single creative can drive massive new customer signups at scale (as Coinbase demonstrated in 2022). If Coinbase’s business case (user acquisition economics, available budget, regulatory posture) supports a high‑reach push, the Super Bowl remains an efficient channel for that objective. Historical evidence and the company’s prior use of QR‑led conversions make this a credible strategic option. citeturn0search3turn0search4

Counterpoints and risks (evidence that would support the NO outcome)

- No public confirmation from authoritative advertiser trackers for 2026: multiple contemporaneous Super Bowl advertiser trackers and lists compiled in January 2026 (industry trackers and writeups) list many confirmed advertisers but do not include Coinbase among the confirmed Super Bowl 60 advertisers at the time of this research; reporting emphasizes other categories (food & beverage, AI, traditional incumbents) and notes a general pullback by crypto firms after earlier years. Absence from those confirmed lists is a signal against a booked Coinbase national spot (though absence is not proof of no buy). citeturn7view5turn7view6

- Sector pullback / reputational/regulatory cost: industry reporting documents a reduced crypto advertiser presence in some recent Super Bowls after major industry shocks (FTX collapse, tighter rules). Advertising trackers and trade coverage have repeatedly described crypto’s Super Bowl presence as diminished and more selective since 2022–2023; regulatory scrutiny (e.g., UK ASA rulings) may raise legal/PR/clearance risk for a high‑profile U.S. national TV campaign. These constraints could deter or delay a Super Bowl buy. citeturn4search2turn4search4

- Cost and slot availability pressure: 30‑ and 60‑second Big Game inventory is extremely costly and often bought months in advance; many brands had slots announced or teasers out by January 2026. If Coinbase had not publicly teased or been named in trade lists by late January, one possibility is they did not finalize a national slot — or they could be buying non‑traditional placements (streaming, localized, or post‑game digital first). Industry trackers and reporting at the time indicate most available national inventory had already been spoken for. citeturn7view5turn7view4

Timeline and decision points

- Jan–early Feb 2026 (now → 2026‑02‑09): Ad‑tracking publications, Ad Age/Mediaradar/industry trackers and press outlets typically publish confirmed advertiser lists and creative teasers in the days and weeks immediately before the game; those lists and trailer releases are the primary near‑term catalysts that would decisively confirm or deny a Coinbase national broadcast buy. citeturn7view5turn7view4

- Super Bowl broadcast date: Feb 9, 2026 — when the ad (if booked) would air. Market close for the prediction is 2026‑02‑09T04:59:00+00:00. Any public evidence of a slot purchase, teaser release, or network confirmation before that time is the key confirmatory data. (Dates in this synthesis are absolute: Jan 31, 2026 is the date of this research; market expiry is Feb 9, 2026.)

Information gaps and limitations

- No primary confirmation of a U.S. national Super Bowl ad buy by Coinbase was located in mainstream trade press, company press releases, or ad‑tracker lists as of Jan 31, 2026. That is an important, explicitly‑stated gap: neither Coinbase’s investor communications nor authoritative ad‑sales trackers in open reporting showed a confirmed Coinbase national spot for Super Bowl L/X at the time of research. citeturn7view5turn7view4

- Some reporting indicates Coinbase is actively running high‑visibility advertising (including the contested UK campaign) and the company has historical operational experience with Big Game creative mechanics — both facts increase the plausibility of a buy but do not substitute for an announcement or ad‑slot confirmation. citeturn7view1turn0search0

- Ad buys can be negotiated privately and announced late (or run under subsidiary/agency names); trackers may lag or exclude some buys. Because of that, absence from currently published trackers is suggestive but not conclusive. No evidence was found of a definitive US broadcast clearance or a network list naming Coinbase for the Big Game through Jan 31, 2026. citeturn7view5

Notes on confidence and next steps for the Recommender (fact‑finding only)
- The most decisive near‑term evidence will be trade confirmations (Ad Age, MediaRadar, iSpot, or network/agency confirmations) and any Coinbase corporate announcement or teaser released prior to Feb 9, 2026. If you want immediate verification, check those trackers and trade outlets daily as ad trailer rolls and advertiser confirmations commonly appear in the final two weeks before the game. 

No trading recommendation or probability estimate is provided here—this product is strictly a factual synthesis to inform the Recommender’s decision process.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is moderate: credible, diverse sources (Guardian, industry trackers) but no primary confirmation and limited recent corroboration. Coinbase’s 2022 Super Bowl success and active 2025–26 campaigns support a high prior, with a proven QR-led acquisition playbook. Against this, as of Jan 31, 2026 Coinbase is absent from confirmed-advertiser trackers, most inventory appears allocated, crypto has pulled back, and regulatory scrutiny adds clearance/PR risk. Late buys are possible but less likely. Insufficient edge at current pricing; stay close to market. Confidence: Medium (≈60%); evidence mixed with notable gaps.
