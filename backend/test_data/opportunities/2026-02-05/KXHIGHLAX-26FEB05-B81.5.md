# Will the **high temp in LA** be 81-82° on Feb 5, 2026?

**Outcome**: 81° to 82°

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: CONFIRMED: The observation period (Feb 5, 2026) is complete and the official KLAX daily temperature record shows the daily maximum exceeded 82°F, so the 81–82° bucket did not occur and the NO side will settle true. Resolution source: National Weather Service / NOAA daily climate observation for KLAX. No-swing checklist: structural lock — measurement period complete and record is fixed; official updates — NWS daily observation governs resolution; no pending challenges — weather station observations are final with no appeals process; low volatility inputs — recorded instrument reading cannot change post-observation; clear resolution source — NWS/NOAA. Remaining risks: None identified. Sources: Kalshi market data (market feed), National Weather Service (KLAX daily climate observation).
