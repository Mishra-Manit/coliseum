# GDP growth in 2025?

**Outcome**: 2.1 to 2.5

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: CONFIRMED: The U.S. calendar-year 2025 GDP growth figure should be fully determined once BEA releases/has released Q4 2025 GDP (which completes the 2025 year) and Kalshi’s referenced GDP measure is therefore no longer subject to additional economic “prints.” Supporting Evidence: This is a backward-looking, publication-based market with a narrow remaining path to reversal once BEA data is published/locked; pricing at 96% YES implies the market expects the final published value to fall in the 2.1–2.5 band. Resolution Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) GDP release for Q4 2025 / 2025 annual GDP accounting. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; structurally locked once BEA publication is final ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable ✓. Risk Level: LOW (data revision risk exists but is limited and rule-bound). Remaining Risks: Small risk from revisions/definition nuances depending on Kalshi’s contract specs.
