# Will more than 2350000 people be screened by the TSA on average this week?

**Outcome**: Above 2.35 million

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: The U.S. is in a high-volume air travel period with recent daily TSA checkpoint counts commonly around ~2.7M+ on peak days, making a >2.35M weekly average a low bar if operations remain normal. Supporting Evidence: TSA itself projected multiple days near ~2.85–2.86M travelers during late-Dec 2025 holiday peaks, indicating the system routinely exceeds 2.35M/day in busy periods; current public reporting also shows daily throughput in the ~2.2–2.7M range in February 2026, so weekly averaging above 2.35M is plausible. Resolution Source: Transportation Security Administration daily checkpoint traveler throughput data (the official TSA-published counts aggregated over the specified week). Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; stable inputs (daily counts are published and mechanically averaged) ✓; no formal challenges/appeals path apparent ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate from this dataset). Remaining Risks: A sharp operational disruption (e.g., prolonged shutdown-related staffing impacts) could depress throughput enough to pull the weekly average below 2.35M.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) whether TSA throughput for the relevant week is still *pending/not yet fully reported*, and (2) any *confirmed* disruptions (shutdown-driven TSA service cuts, widespread cancellations) that could plausibly drag the *weekly average* below 2.35M. Reporting today (Feb 22, 2026) indicates DHS/TSA publicly walked back or softened the PreCheck suspension and TSA said PreCheck remains operational, with operations described as broadly normal so far despite the partial shutdown. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/dc1d2ccd913a74fa2c8b91dad340a3b3?utm_source=openai))

The only credible “showstopper” that could flip the outcome would be if the determining event (this week’s full set of daily TSA checkpoint counts) is not yet complete at market close, *and* the remaining day(s) come in far below 2.35M due to a major, confirmed nationwide disruption (e.g., severe weather causing mass cancellations, or an explicitly confirmed TSA operational shutdown). I found no explicit confirmation of such a nationwide throughput collapse—only warnings that shutdown impacts could worsen over time, plus some storm-related cancellations that appear regional.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → proceed with HIGH confidence (research found no confirmed nationwide disruption or reporting issue that could plausibly flip the weekly TSA-average outcome before close).
