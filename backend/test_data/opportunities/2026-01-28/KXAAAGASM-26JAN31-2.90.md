# Will average **gas prices** be above $2.90?

**Outcome**: Above $2.90

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 7-cent spread, very high volume (168,830 contracts), market yes_ask=78 → implies 78% probability >$2.90 at close (close time 2026-01-31T04:59:00Z). Research findings: multiple authoritative trackers show the U.S. national average retail gasoline price in the low-to-mid $2.80s in late January 2026 (AAA and GasBuddy), while the EIA weekly petroleum status reports showed gasoline inventories recently stable-to-rising—factors that put downward pressure on retail prices. Edge thesis: given current national average ~ $2.83–$2.85 and rising/stable inventories, there is a realistic chance retail prices remain below $2.90 by Jan 31; the market’s ~78% implied probability appears elevated and may be pricing in a supply shock that has not materialized.

## Research Synthesis

### Researched Questions
- What was the U.S. national average retail gasoline price and short-term trend in late January 2026? 
- What do recent EIA weekly petroleum data and industry trackers show for gasoline inventories, production, and refinery utilization (weeks through Jan 16–23, 2026)?
- What near-term supply or demand shocks (crude price moves, refinery outages/maintenance, winter storms, geopolitical risks) could move the national average through Jan 31, 2026?
- What historical/base-rate context is relevant for the end-of-January national average relative to a $2.90 threshold?

Research Synthesis

Event overview

The market question is whether the U.S. national-average retail gasoline price will be above $2.90 at the contract close on 2026-01-31T04:59:00Z. In mid-to-late January 2026 the major retail trackers reported national averages in the low-to-mid $2.80s (AAA reported $2.84 on Jan 15 and $2.85 on Jan 22). These price levels are below $2.90 but within a few cents of that threshold, so small supply/demand moves could push the average either side of $2.90. citeturn0search1turn0search3

Key drivers and dependencies

1) Stocks and refinery flows — EIA weekly data and industry summaries show inventories rising in mid-January 2026. EIA-linked weekly summaries for the week ending Jan 16 reported U.S. crude inventories up ~3.6 million barrels and total motor gasoline inventories increasing by about 6.0 million barrels; the reports noted gasoline stocks were above the five‑year average for the time of year. Higher gasoline stocks are typically downward pressure on retail prices absent offsetting demand or production disruption. citeturn0search2turn2search1

2) Refinery availability — independent tracker estimates (IIR Energy and media summaries) indicated a meaningful amount of U.S. refining capacity offline in mid‑ to late‑January (IIR’s weekly snapshot showed offline capacity rising to roughly 1.1 million barrels per day for the week ending Jan 23). Reduced operable refining capacity reduces gasoline output or increases reliance on imports and can support higher retail prices if persistent. This is a short‑term supply risk that could counteract rising inventories if outages persist or deepen. citeturn2search3turn2search4

3) Crude oil price and market sentiment — reports in the AAA commentary and market coverage placed crude in roughly the high‑$50s to low‑$60s per barrel in January 2026; traders also monitor geopolitical developments (e.g., tensions involving Iran) that can quickly change crude price expectations. Since crude is a primary input to gasoline, substantial upward moves in crude between now and Jan 31 would put upward pressure on retail pump prices. AAA explicitly called out geopolitical disruption as a downside risk to the low winter prices. citeturn0search3turn0search1

4) Seasonal demand and short-window timing — January is typically low‑demand season for gasoline in the U.S.; AAA and several trackers note demand is at seasonal lows in late January and that prices often dip in January because of lower driving and cheaper winter-blend gasoline. This seasonal weakness is a tailwind for staying below $2.90 unless supply shocks occur. The market close on Jan 31 falls before the usual spring demand ramp, increasing the relative importance of near-term supply shocks and the EIA weekly releases between now and the contract close. citeturn0search3turn0search1

Counterpoints and risks

- Inventory gains reported in the week ending Jan 16 could be reversed quickly. Industry trackers reported rising offline refinery capacity for the week ending Jan 23 (1.1M bpd offline by IIR measures). If refinery outages are unplanned, prolonged, or concentrated on the U.S. Gulf Coast (a major supplier region), gasoline production could drop and inventories fall on subsequent EIA releases, supporting higher prices. citeturn2search3turn2search1

- Weather and operational disruptions: recent winter storms in parts of the country and regional refinery disruptions were cited in local coverage as drivers of localized price jumps. Localized disruptions can push the national average if broad enough or if they coincide with reduced imports. Media reports in late January also flagged cold snaps that affect fuels and logistics. citeturn0news12turn0news13

- Geopolitics and crude price shocks: AAA and industry commentary flagged geopolitical tensions (e.g., Iran-related sanctions/news) as a quick channel to higher crude and then retail prices. Crude markets remain sensitive to geopolitical headlines; a sustained crude rally could lift pump prices before Jan 31. citeturn0search3turn0search1

Base rates and historical precedent

Historically, national gasoline averages have ranged widely (multi‑dollar swings in past years). Annual and multi‑year data show average U.S. gasoline prices have exceeded $3+/gal in several recent years (2021–2023 peaks) but have also been below $3 in low-demand periods; trackers published in January 2026 put weekly national averages in early/mid January around $2.81–2.85. The base‑rate context is that late‑January averages are frequently at or below the winter seasonal mean unless disrupted by supply shocks. That base rate supports the view that staying below $2.90 through Jan 31 is plausible absent a supply shock. (See historical yearly and weekly series from EIA-derived datasets and price‑watch aggregators.) citeturn1search0turn1search3

Timeline and decision points before contract close (2026-01-31T04:59Z)

- Jan 28, 2026 (EIA weekly release covering week ending Jan 23): This EIA release is the major scheduled data point between now and Jan 31 and will report inventories, production, and refinery utilization; it can materially move market expectations for Jan 31. The EIA’s weekly release schedule shows Wednesday releases are the regular cadence. citeturn0search4turn2search1

- Any same‑week unplanned refinery outages or new weather events between Jan 26–31: Industry outage trackers (IIR/Energy intelligence) and local news will be the first sources to flag these; outages in major refining hubs would be a critical upside risk. citeturn2search3

- Crude price moves and geopolitical headlines: sustained upward movement in Brent/WTI or sharp geopolitical events before Jan 31 would be relevant immediate drivers. Monitor major price feeds and market coverage in real time.

What would change the outlook (examples only — not probability estimates)

Factors that would increase the likelihood of the national average rising above $2.90 by Jan 31:
- A significant unexpected drop in gasoline inventories on the EIA release (week ending Jan 23) or sharp reduction in gasoline production due to unplanned refinery outages. citeturn2search1turn2search3
- A sustained crude oil price rally driven by geopolitical events or demand surprises over the remainder of January. citeturn0search3

Factors that would increase the likelihood of remaining below $2.90:
- Continued inventory builds or stable/high inventories in successive EIA weekly reports and no escalation in refinery outages. citeturn0search2
- Lack of material crude price upside and continued seasonally low gasoline demand through the end of January. citeturn0search3

Limitations and missing information

- The most recent EIA weekly release covering the week ending Jan 23 (release date Jan 28) and real‑time refinery outage updates are the single most important data items for this question; depending on timing, some local or proprietary outage reports may appear after the EIA snapshot. If more granular state/regional inventory or refinery status data (IIR, RBN, Platts) are available they should be consulted for a finer view.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is moderate: credible and diverse sources (AAA, EIA summaries, GasBuddy, IIR) with clear discussion of seasonality, inventories, outages, and crude. Recency is decent but missing the Jan 28 EIA release and real‑time refinery outage updates—key gaps that limit confidence. Trackers placed the national average in the low‑to‑mid $2.80s; rising inventories and weak seasonal demand lean against a quick move above $2.90, but elevated offline refining capacity and headline‑driven crude spikes are real upside risks. Given the short window to Jan 31 and incomplete latest data, I estimate YES at 0.48. Edge for YES is negative (−30%), EV < 0, and Kelly size 0%. Confidence < 60%.
