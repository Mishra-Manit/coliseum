# Will legislation that prevents a lapse in federal appropriations for all 12 bills become law before Jan 30, 2026?

**Outcome**: Before Jan 30, 2026

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 1-cent spread, volume 42,486, yes_ask=5 (implied 5% chance the strict "no lapse for all 12 appropriations" condition will be enacted before Jan 30), close 2026-01-30T15:00:00Z. Research findings: Congress.gov shows H.R.6938 (a consolidated appropriations act covering multiple FY2026 bills) became law on Jan 23, 2026 (Public Law No: 119-74), indicating Congress has enacted multi-bill packages already; press coverage and prediction markets continue to show nontrivial odds of a funding lapse/ shutdown risk into Jan 31, 2026. Edge thesis: The market prices the “no lapse for all 12” outcome at only ~5%, despite several full-year appropriations being enacted and active floor activity on remaining bills; because the market's contract is a strict, all-12 condition (not just a CR), careful legislative tracking of which bills remain, floor calendars, and leadership statements could reveal a higher-than-priced probability before close.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- Which of the 12 regular FY2026 appropriations bills have been enacted into law (or sent to the Senate/President) as of January 28, 2026?
- What is the current legislative posture for the remaining appropriations (packages on the floor, procedural obstacles, and leadership positions that could affect passage before Jan 30, 2026)?
- What recent events or political dynamics are increasing or decreasing the odds that all 12 bills (or a single bill preventing any lapse across all 12) will become law before Jan 30, 2026?
- What are the relevant historical base rates and precedents for Congress passing all 12 appropriations on time, and how should those shape expectations for this window?

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

Congress has enacted multi-bill consolidated measures for portions of FY2026 appropriations and, as of January 23, 2026, H.R.6938 (a consolidated bill covering Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy & Water, and Interior/Environment divisions) “Became Public Law No: 119-74.” citeturn0search0 The Congressional Research Service Appropriations Status Table shows multiple consolidated packages in play and was updated on January 23, 2026 to reflect recent activity and continuing work on outstanding divisions. That table is the canonical CRS snapshot used to track which of the 12 bills are enacted, pending in the Senate, or awaiting House action. citeturn0search3

Key Drivers and Dependencies

1) Legislative packaging and venue: House leaders have passed consolidated packages that bundle several regular appropriations into a single vehicle (e.g., the Consolidated Appropriations Act language in H.R.7148 and other packages moved by the House on Jan 22–23). The House has signaled completion of its internal work by passing several consolidated measures and sending them to the Senate; the Senate schedule and cloture requirements determine how quickly the packages can be considered. citeturn2search1turn2search0

2) Senate procedures and the 60‑vote hurdle: Even when the House passes large consolidated bills, the Senate’s cloture rules and any holds or filibusters mean leadership often needs bipartisan support or a supermajority to finish action quickly—especially when contentious policy riders (e.g., DHS/ICE language) are included. The Senate’s floor calendar (daily program language and cloture votes) is therefore a gating factor for passage before a tight deadline. citeturn0search1turn0search2

3) Political flashpoints: Recent high-profile law‑enforcement/ICE incidents have prompted Senate Democrats to take public positions against the Homeland Security funding measure included in the consolidated package, making DHS funding the principal flashpoint that could precipitate a hold-up. Multiple news reports and Associated Press coverage describe Senate Democratic opposition to the DHS portion and link that opposition directly to increased shutdown risk. citeturn1search0

Counterpoints and Risks

Bullish (for an all‑12 no‑lapse outcome):
- House progress: The House has passed consolidated vehicles that, if the Senate agrees or negotiates quickly, provide a legislative route to complete the remaining appropriations before the deadline. The January 22 House votes (multiple consolidated bills) show a completed House-side markup and passage effort that reduces one procedural barrier. citeturn2search1turn2search3
- Recent enacted laws: At least one multi-bill package (H.R.6938) has already become law, demonstrating that consolidated approaches can clear the process quickly and that enactment of multiple bills in one vehicle is an available path. citeturn0search0

Bearish (risk of a lapse):
- DHS/ICE opposition: Multiple outlets report that Senate Democrats are publicly opposing the DHS funding language in the consolidated package after high‑profile shootings, and key Democratic negotiators have said they will not provide votes unless changes are made—raising the chance the Senate will not clear a full package before the Jan 30 cutoff. citeturn1search0
- Senate timing and cloture mechanics: Even with House-passed packages, the Senate needs time for debate, amendments, and cloture votes. A late-arriving or contentious amendment or a sustained opposition strategy can delay final passage past a hard deadline. The Senate daily program and Congressional Record entries show limited floor time in the days immediately preceding Jan 30 (programs and cloture schedules matter materially). citeturn0search1turn0search2

Timeline and Decision Points

- Jan 22–23, 2026: House passage of consolidated packages (H.R.7148, H.R.7147 and others) and H.R.6938 enacted into law on Jan 23; these are major House-side milestones and are already reflected in the CRS Appropriations Status Table. citeturn2search1turn0search0turn0search3
- Jan 26–30, 2026: Senate floor consideration window. The Senate must schedule cloture and final passage votes, and any failure to secure cloture (or to negotiate DHS language acceptable to enough Democrats or Republicans) would push final action past the Jan 30 deadline.
- Short-term fallback: if the Senate cannot pass a full set of measures, Congress typically resorts to a Continuing Resolution (CR) or a shorter stopgap for some appropriations. Historically, CRs and omnibus consolidations have been the default when regular order fails.

What Would Change the Outlook

Factors that would materially raise the chance of an all‑12 enacted outcome before Jan 30:
- A rapid Senate agreement to consider the House packages under a time agreement (consent or unanimous-consent package) that avoids protracted floor fights.
- A negotiated fix or carve‑out for DHS language that wins the support of key Senate Democrats (public statements from appropriations leaders or a formal amendment that addresses the specific complaints).
- Republican unity in the Senate to pass the package without Democratic votes (possible but depends on intra‑party cohesion and willingness to run the political optics of a one‑party passage).

Factors that would materially lower the chance:
- Sustained Senate Democratic opposition to DHS funding language, including public refusals to provide cloture votes.
- Last‑minute contentious amendments or procedural holds that consume Senate floor time and prevent cloture before the Jan 30 cutoff.
- Unanticipated political developments (new incidents or external shocks) that harden positions and make compromise less likely.

Historical Base Rates and Precedents

Congress has not consistently passed all 12 regular appropriations bills on time in recent decades; the modern appropriations process increasingly relies on consolidated omnibus bills and CRs. Analyses tracking the timeliness of the 12‑bill process show that enactment of all 12 by Oct. 1 is rare (governance trackers cite FY1997/1996 as the last comparable on‑time occurrences under different definitions), and CRS/analysts note multiple consolidated packages and CR usage are the norm. This long‑term pattern indicates that while omnibus/consolidated vehicles are viable to enact multiple bills quickly, “on time” passage of every single regular bill is a historical outlier—so the baseline legislative environment is one where stopgaps and bundling are commonplace. citeturn5search0turn5search7

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is mixed: credible primary sources (Congress.gov, CRS) and timely updates, but some secondary links are vague/uncorroborated and the research does not enumerate exactly which of the 12 bills remain or show a Senate time agreement/cloture path. Conflicting evidence centers on DHS language and limited Senate floor time before Jan 30. Historical base rates for completing all 12 on time are very low, and the strict “all‑12, no lapse” condition is hard to meet within days. Given procedure and timing risks, I estimate YES at ~4%, near/below market. Edge is under the 5% threshold and confidence is below 60%, so any aggressive positioning is not warranted.
