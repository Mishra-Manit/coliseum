# Will Ja Morant be traded by Memphis before Feb 6, 2026

**Outcome**: Ja Morant

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market yes price 31% (implied: ~31% probability Morant is traded before Feb 6). Market metrics supporting liquidity: volume=97,358; spread=3¢ (0.03). Research signal: recent reporting and team/injury updates through late January show limited confirmed trade traction publicly; the market may be overpricing trade likelihood ahead of deadline-driven rumor flow. Repricing catalyst: Trade-deadline news/rumors and front-office statements between now and Feb 6 will likely compress information asymmetry and move price. Confidence: Medium.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- Are the Memphis Grizzlies actively entertaining offers for Ja Morant (recent, verifiable reporting)?
- What public statements have Grizzlies front office figures made about Morant’s trade status (most relevant/dated quotes)?
- What is Ja Morant’s current injury/availability status that could affect trade interest or timing?
- What recent league precedents show that high-profile, midseason star trades can happen unexpectedly (relevant examples)?

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

Market question: Will Ja Morant be traded by Memphis before 2026-02-06T04:59:00+00:00 (trade-deadline window). Relevant, verifiable reporting in January 2026 establishes two competing narratives: (1) ESPN (Shams Charania) reported on Jan 9, 2026 that, for the first time, the Grizzlies were "entertaining offers" for Ja Morant and that multiple teams were pursuing him; and (2) a range of earlier/related pieces record public pushback from Memphis leadership in 2025 where GM Zach Kleiman previously called trade talk "fantasy." Separately, league injury reporting (NBA.com) in mid-January 2026 documents a right calf contusion that kept Morant out of some games. These are the core facts that drive the market between now (Jan 28, 2026) and the deadline.

Key Drivers

1) Verified media reporting that Memphis has "entertained offers": ESPN’s Jan 9, 2026 coverage (Shams Charania and NBA insiders) is a primary, contemporaneous source saying Memphis has engaged other teams and is listening on Morant; multiple trade-package ideas and team fits were published by ESPN and replicated by SI and other outlets. This reporting is the most direct piece of bullish evidence that a trade is operationally possible in the short window before the deadline.

2) Front-office public posture and prior denials: Multiple reputable outlets (CBS Sports, HoopsRumors, Sports Illustrated aggregation of statements) document earlier comments from GM Zach Kleiman (February 2025) denying trade intent—"We are not trading Ja"—which reflects either a sustained organizational stance or an earlier position that may have shifted. The existence of a relatively recent, explicit public denial (from the franchise’s decision-maker) is bearish evidence for an imminent trade absent a reversal.

3) Player availability and medical status: NBA.com (Jan 14, 2026) reports Morant missed games with a right calf contusion and had been out for several games; other outlets corroborate calf/ankle issues across late 2025 into January 2026. Availability/injury risks affect trade desirability and the types of offers Memphis could expect, and they may delay or dampen immediate trade execution until medical clarity is provided.

4) Market mechanics and league precedent: The NBA has recent examples (e.g., the Luka Dončić blockbuster trade reported/confirmed in early February 2025) showing that high-profile, seemingly improbable midseason trades can and do occur. League behavior after major shock trades tends to increase rumor activity and front-office readiness to both make and consider large moves; that precedent is relevant to market participants’ expectations.

Counterpoints and Risks

- Reliability & granularity of "entertaining offers": ESPN’s sourcing is strong, but the phrase "entertaining offers" does not equal a completed trade or a firm public offer list. No public documentation of concrete offers (terms, teams committing assets) was found in the searches—only reporting that talks were taking place or that Memphis was listening. There is no verified list of suitors that have submitted firm, trade-ready packages in the public domain.

- Public denials from the Grizzlies leadership: Multiple outlets preserve Kleiman’s earlier categorical denial ("We are not trading Ja") from Feb 2025. Even if that quote is older, it remains part of the public record and signals organizational reluctance that could persist unless higher-level strategy or roster pressures change.

- Injury/availability: Confirmed calf contusion and periods of absence (NBA.com and other local reporting) introduce medical uncertainty. Teams considering Morant will factor in current and recent injuries, which can reduce the pool of willing suitors or the value they are willing to send immediately.

- No public confirmation of player request: Multiple outlets (including follow-ups) report that Morant has given short answers to trade chatter and has stated he wants to remain (reported by local and national outlets). There is no public, verifiable report that Morant demanded a trade or formally requested one as of the searches.

Timeline (key dates and decision points)

- Jan 9, 2026: ESPN (Shams Charania) reports Memphis is "entertaining offers" for Ja Morant. (Primary new-signal date for market price movement.)
- Jan 14, 2026: NBA.com reports Morant ruled out of the Berlin game with a right calf contusion—public injury update that affects availability and valuation.
- Jan 18–21, 2026: Various local and national outlets report Morant publicly expressing desire to stay / responding to trade chatter (e.g., short statements such as "live with it" in media appearances); additional rumor pieces and speculative trade proposals circulate.
- Feb 5–6, 2026 (market close per event): League trade deadline period—last window for trades to clear before the market’s specified close time (opportunity close: 2026-02-06T04:59:00+00:00). Reporting and rumor flow typically intensify in the 48–72 hours before the deadline.

Information Gaps

- No public record of concrete trade offers or terms (which teams, which assets) has been located in the searches; ESPN’s "entertaining offers" is not accompanied in public reporting by published offers with guarantees.

- Internal Memphis valuation and exact strategic objective (retool vs. rebuild) are not publicly documented in a way that specifies a threshold for a deal to be accepted.

- Medical details beyond team injury reports (e.g., independent second opinions, exact recovery timelines) are not publicly available; those would materially affect trade interest.

- Private conversations among rival executives and any confidential offers submitted to Memphis are, by their nature, not visible in public sources and remain an unknown.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | -3% | -10% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | +0% | -0% | 0.0% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence is credible and recent (ESPN, NBA.com, SI, AP) but lacks concrete offer terms, limiting certainty. ESPN’s “entertaining offers” opens a path, yet prior GM denials, no trade request, and Morant’s calf contusion all dampen near-term execution odds before the deadline. Base rate for midseason superstar trades is low despite notable precedents. Mixed signals and information gaps on Memphis’s internal strategy persist. Insufficient edge at current price; market likely overstates near-term trade probability. Confidence: Medium.
