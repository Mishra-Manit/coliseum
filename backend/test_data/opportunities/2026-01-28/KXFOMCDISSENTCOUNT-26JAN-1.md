# How many dissenting votes at the next Fed meeting?

**Outcome**: 1

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 2-cent spread, volume 20,785, yes_ask=54 (implied 54% for exactly 1 dissent), close 2026-01-28T18:59:00Z. Research findings: The December 2025 FOMC vote produced three dissenting votes (9–3 split), highlighting unusually high internal division at recent meetings and greater variability in dissent counts than typical. Analysts and coverage leading into the Jan 2026 meeting emphasize that internal splits remain material and that outcomes could easily produce 0, 1, 2, or 3 dissents (i.e., a wide distribution). Edge thesis: The market pins a majority probability on exactly one dissent (54%) with a tight spread and good liquidity; given recent 3-dissent outcomes and commentary that views remain widely dispersed, the probability mass may be more spread across 0/2/3 dissents than concentrated at exactly 1 — creating a researchable edge to exploit short-term mispricing around the discrete dissent-count distribution.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- What was the dissent count and who dissented at the December 9–10, 2025 FOMC meeting, and what reasons did dissenters give? 
- What are the historical base rates for FOMC dissenting votes (per meeting and per vote), and how unusual is a 3‑dissent meeting in recent decades? 
- What pre‑meeting factors (voter composition, recent data, Fed communications) are likely to drive the number of dissents at the January 27–28, 2026 meeting? 
- What are the decision/timing points (when the dissent count becomes known, where additional information will appear) and which developments would materially alter the likely dissent distribution between 0/1/2/3+ dissents?

Research Synthesis

Event overview

This market resolves to the count of dissenting votes at the next FOMC meeting (market closes 2026‑01‑28T18:59:00Z). The FOMC’s prior meeting (Dec. 9–10, 2025) recorded a 9–3 vote on a 25‑bp cut; the official Board press release states in plain terms that “the Committee voted 9–3.” The three identified dissenters were Stephen I. Miran, Austan D. Goolsbee and Jeffrey R. Schmid; those officials subsequently published short dissent statements explaining divergent views (two preferring no cut, one preferring a larger cut). The Fed also set the next meeting on Jan. 27–28, 2026.

Key drivers and dependencies

1) Recent meeting mechanics and visible rationales. The December meeting produced three dissents with heterogeneous rationales: two voting members opposed the cut because they judged inflation still too high or preferred more data, while another preferred a larger cut on labor‑market concerns. Dissent statements published by the Chicago Fed (A. Goolsbee) and the Kansas City Fed (J. Schmid) and the Board press release show these split motivations—i.e., dissents can run in both hawkish and dovish directions in the same meeting.

2) Historical base rates and precedent. Long‑run historical work compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (based on Thornton & Wheelock) shows that formal dissents are a minority of votes: historically “only 6% of the votes cast for FOMC policy directives were dissents” (St. Louis Fed dataset updated through Dec. 2025). The St. Louis Fed material also notes that multi‑dissent meetings (2–3+ dissents) are less common in the post‑2010 period, and that three dissents was the most since 2019—so December’s 3‑dissent result is notable versus recent years but not unprecedented over a longer horizon.

3) Committee composition and rotation. The set of voting participants at any meeting matters because five regional Fed presidents rotate onto the voting panel each year (the New York Fed president is a permanent voter). Several market and press pieces note an upcoming rotation and potential board turnover in 2026 that could shift the mix of hawks and doves. That change in the voting roster (and any Board appointments or reappointments) is an important structural input: it changes who is eligible to cast a formal dissent and may therefore affect the distribution of dissent counts.

4) Data and forward guidance before Jan meeting. The January meeting will have fresh labor‑market and inflation data (jobs reports, CPI/PCE releases) that meeting participants explicitly referenced as important for timing decisions. Because dissent rationales in December cited incomplete data and divergent readings, incoming data that clarifies inflation or labor weakness will be a proximate driver of whether more members coalesce around a single action or split.

Counterpoints and risks

- December’s three dissents are a salient data point, but historical context leans the other way: dissents as a share of votes are low relative to earlier decades, and most meetings have zero to one dissenter. That argues that a 3‑dissent outcome could be an outlier rather than the new norm. 

- Rotation and personnel changes can work in opposite directions. Some coverage suggests 2026 rotation could make the committee marginally more dovish (reducing incentive to dissent against cuts), while other analysis emphasizes sustained hawkish sentiment among several regional presidents. The exact net effect on dissent frequency is ambiguous and depends on which individuals actually vote in January (and on any Board changes before the meeting).

- Public statements/dissent timing: dissent counts and names are revealed immediately in the committee statement at the time of the decision. That means the market resolves at the moment the FOMC statement is issued; later minutes provide fuller reasoning but not additional vote counts. The implication is that any pre‑market informational edge must rely on observable public signals (speeches, published statements from regional presidents/governors, and incoming economic data) that are available before the statement is released.

Timeline and decision points

- Immediate: Jan. 27–28, 2026 FOMC meeting. The committee issues its policy statement and (if scheduled) a press conference; the statement includes the vote tally (and names of dissenters). That is the resolution event for this market. 

- Pre‑meeting window: jobs reports and monthly inflation measures that are released in the weeks and days before the meeting are the primary observable inputs that could shift member votes. Public speeches and short dissent statements published by regional banks (as happened after December) are also informative.

- Post‑meeting: meeting minutes and fuller explanations are released later (minutes generally published a few weeks after) and will illuminate rationales but won’t change the recorded dissent count.

What would change the outlook

- New or materially different inflation or payrolls data received before Jan 27–28 would be the clearest near‑term factor likely to change the expected dissent distribution. 

- Any announced Board seat changes or public statements by newly eligible voting regional presidents between now and the meeting (or an explicit change in a voting roster) would alter the set of people who can dissent and therefore the distribution. 

- If multiple officials publicly align their views (e.g., a string of regional presidents publish statements favoring hold vs cut), that could concentrate votes and reduce multi‑dissent probability; conversely, continued heterogenous public commentary would support a wider distribution of dissent counts.

Summary (objective takeaways)

- The December 2025 9–3 vote is a recent, clearly documented case of elevated dissent with named, published dissent statements showing heterogeneous rationales. 
- Historically, dissent votes are uncommon as a share of votes, and multi‑dissent meetings are not the modal outcome; the St. Louis Fed’s historical tracking is the best single source for those base rates. 
- Key near‑term drivers for the Jan. 27–28 meeting are incoming labor and inflation data, any public positioning by voting members, and the precise composition of the voting panel; dissent counts are revealed immediately in the Fed statement at decision time.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is solid: primary Fed releases and St. Louis Fed history plus diverse mainstream coverage; recency is good (Dec 2025). The research correctly highlights both elevated recent dissent (three in Dec) and base rates that favor 0–1 dissenters. However, it lacks quantified probabilities for the exact “1 dissent” outcome, detailed 2026 voter roster analysis, and pre‑meeting speech/data synthesis, leaving significant uncertainty. Given likely dispersion across 0/2/3 and historical pull toward 0–1, I estimate P(1 dissent) ≈ 0.51 versus market 0.54. Edge is -3% and expected value negative, below the 5% threshold. Confidence is below 60%; position size per Kelly caps at 0%.
