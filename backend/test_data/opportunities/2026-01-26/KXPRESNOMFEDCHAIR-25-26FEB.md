# Will Trump announce his new Chair of the Federal Reserve in 2026?

**Outcome**: Before February

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 1-cent spread, 771,794 contracts volume (extremely liquid), yes ask = 34 → implied yes = 34% (no = 67%). Closes 2026-02-01T04:59:00Z. Research findings & edge thesis: Presidential personnel announcements are heavily covered and often leaked ahead of formal announcement; tracking White House schedules, credible press reports, and filings (e.g., Senate calendar for confirmation hearings) can expose information asymmetry before the market moves. The high volume plus sub-50% pricing suggests tradeable disagreement between market and probable news flow timelines. Sources: https://www.reuters.com, https://www.whitehouse.gov
