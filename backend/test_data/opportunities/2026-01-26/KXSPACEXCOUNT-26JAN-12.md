# How many launches will SpaceX have in 2026?

**Outcome**: Above 12

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 5-cent spread, 206,993 contracts volume, yes ask = 23 → implied yes = 23% (no = 82%). Closes 2026-02-01T15:00:00Z. Research findings & edge thesis: SpaceX publishes launch manifests and upcoming launches (and federal filings / range schedules) are reported by launch trackers and press; aggregating scheduled launches, customer manifests and range availability may reveal whether >12 flights in 2026 is likely. Given the high volume and relatively tight spread, focused manifest-level research (customer manifests, FAA/NASA filings and range bookings) could reveal under- or over-pricing.
