# Will average gas prices be above $2.95 by Jan 31, 2026?

**Outcome**: Above $2.95

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 6-cent spread, 71,413 contracts volume, yes ask = 15 → implied yes = 15% (no = 91%). Closes 2026-01-31T04:59:00Z. Research findings & edge thesis: National average pump prices are published weekly by AAA and EIA; short-term price moves are driven by refinery throughput, inventory levels, and crude prices—public data that can be monitored to spot divergence from the market’s 15% probability. If near-term EIA/AAA reports or refinery disruptions differ from market expectations, there is space for a trade. Sources: https://www.eia.gov, https://gasprices.aaa.com

## Research Synthesis

# Researched Questions

- What is the current U.S. national average retail gasoline price and the recent weekly trend through late January 2026? 
- What are the latest U.S. gasoline inventory and refinery utilization trends that affect near-term supply/demand balance?
- What recent developments in crude oil supply (OPEC+/geopolitics) or crude price trends could push pump prices above $2.95 by Jan 31, 2026?
- What historical/seasonal precedents (base rates) exist for national average gasoline price behavior in late January and which data releases or events between now and Jan 31 are likely decision points?

Research Synthesis

Event Overview

The market question is whether the U.S. national average retail gasoline price will be above $2.95 by January 31, 2026. As of late January 2026 the national average reported by AAA was $2.85 (January 22, 2026 bulletin) and weekly EIA-linked series show the U.S. conventional retail gasoline price near $2.79–2.80 for the week of Jan 19, 2026 — both below the $2.95 threshold. citeturn0search4turn0search5

Key Drivers and Dependencies

1) Current retail level and recent trajectory: AAA’s January 22, 2026 update states the national average is $2.85 and notes prices have nudged higher in mid–late January after hitting low levels to start the year. Weekly series show a modest upward trend from early January but still below $2.95. These datasets set the immediate baseline from which any move above $2.95 would need to occur. citeturn0search4turn0search5

2) Product inventories and refinery throughput: EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status reporting (as summarized in market briefs) shows gasoline inventories increased by around 6.0 million barrels in the week ending Jan 16, 2026 and are roughly five percent above the five‑year average for this time of year, while crude inventories are a few percent below the five‑year average. U.S. refinery utilization has recently been in the low‑to‑mid 90s percent range (e.g., ~93.3% for the week of Jan 16, 2026), down from some prior weeks — meaning refiners are running but not at exceptional tightness. Higher-than-average gasoline stocks and only-normal utilization weaken near-term upside to pump prices from a supply‑squeeze perspective. citeturn0search3turn0search6turn0search1

3) Crude oil supply and OPEC+/geopolitics: OPEC+ has signaled a continued pause or extension of voluntary/unwinding schedules into Q1 2026, keeping a material package of cuts in place through at least early 2026. Several recent reports indicate OPEC+ decisions and voluntary cuts are supporting a floor in crude prices; however, global demand forecasts from agencies (IEA/EIA) and the presence of some surplus in parts of 2025–2026 mean crude is not under extreme upward pressure at present. In short, OPEC+ policy is a bullish push for crude (and therefore gasoline) but is partly counterbalanced by demand softness and existing inventories. citeturn1search1turn1search4turn1news13

Counterpoints and Risks (evidence that argues against the price crossing $2.95)

- Inventory cushion: Recent weekly data show motor gasoline inventories rose and are above the five‑year seasonal average, which historically reduces the probability of sharp retail price spikes absent a large, sudden disruption. The EIA summary (and market briefs summarizing it) specifically note the +6.0 million barrel weekly gasoline build. citeturn0search3turn0search6

- Seasonal and historical baseline: January is typically the weakest month for gasoline demand and seasonal factors (BLS/PPI seasonal tables and historical series) show January usually produces downward pressure on pump prices vs spring driving season. That seasonal base rate makes an above‑threshold move late in January less likely unless an outsized supply shock or crude rally occurs. citeturn2search2turn0search5

- Crude market context: While OPEC+ policy reduces downside risk to crude, multiple reports note lingering global supply growth and subdued demand expectations in early 2026; many market participants view the balance as not dramatically tight. If crude remains stable in the mid‑$50s to low‑$60s per barrel range, gasoline retail moves are more likely to be modest. citeturn1news13turn1search7

Bullish evidence (factors that could push the national average above $2.95 quickly)

- OPEC+/geopolitical upside or sudden crude shock: If voluntary production discipline tightens further, or geopolitical events materially remove barrels (e.g., new sanctions, infrastructure attacks, or supply interruptions in key exporters), crude could spike and pass through to retail prices before Jan 31. Recent coverage notes OPEC+ has kept cuts in place into 2026, which could support price upside if demand surprises. citeturn1search1turn1search4

- Refinery outages or weather‑related disruptions: Refineries operating in winter with planned or unplanned outages (and regional outages in key refining hubs) can cause regional pump price spikes that lift the national average if large enough; recent local reporting showed some regional price increases (e.g., state or metro area weekly surveys) tied to weather and local disruptions. Because refinery throughput is a short‑lead indicator for retail prices, a new outage between now and Jan 31 could change the outlook quickly. citeturn0news12turn0search1

Timeline and Decision Points

- Immediate weekly EIA/AAA releases: The EIA weekly petroleum status updates (released each Wednesday) and AAA weekly national average updates (typically published midweek) are the primary scheduled datapoints through Jan 31 that will move market expectations. The next few weekly EIA releases (the Jan 21 and Jan 28 releases) and AAA updates will be critical. citeturn0search2turn0search4

- Unscheduled events: Any announced refinery outages, major weather disruptions, or sudden changes in OPEC+ communications (emergency meetings or new voluntary cuts) would be the most important unscheduled decision points.

What Would Change the Outlook (key triggers to watch)

- Downside moves: Continued and repeated gasoline inventory builds above the five‑year seasonal average, and falling crude prices (below the current mid‑$50s–$60s range), would make crossing $2.95 by Jan 31 much less likely. Watch weekly EIA gasoline stocks and crude price trajectories.

- Upside moves: Increasing crude prices driven by tighter OPEC+ compliance/extended voluntary cuts, new sanctions, or a large refinery outage affecting a major hub could shift retail prices upward quickly. Because retail prices lag crude and refinery changes by days–weeks, any such event in the final full week of January would be the decisive window. citeturn0search6turn1search1

Gaps and Uncertainties

- Regional variation vs national average: National averages can mask substantial regional divergence; a big regional spike (e.g., Gulf Coast or West Coast) can raise national averages but not always as fast as futures markets anticipate. Public weekly sources provide national snapshots but less granular intraday detail on local disruptions.

- Timing sensitivity: The market closes on Jan 31, 2026 — a short horizon. Many key risks are sudden (outages, geopolitics, weather), so real‑time monitoring of EIA weekly reports, AAA updates, crude futures, and refinery outage reports matters more here than longer‑term structural analysis.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | +0% | +0% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | -6% | -7% | 0.0% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is very weak: 0 credible sources, no primary data for current national gasoline prices, inventories, refinery runs, crude market drivers, or seasonal/base-rate context. Sources lack credibility, diversity, and recency; key questions are unanswered and no conflicting evidence is evaluated. Given the absence of reliable information, I anchor to the market price and estimate the true YES probability at ~15%. With p aligned to price, edge = 0% and EV = 0, producing a 0% Kelly position. Edge is below the 5% threshold and confidence is well under 60%. Stronger, timely EIA/AAA/OPEC/futures-based evidence is required before deviating from market.
