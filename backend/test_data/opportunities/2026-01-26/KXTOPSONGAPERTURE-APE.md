# Will Aperture be the #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 charts this week?

**Outcome**: Aperture

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 5-cent spread, 94,702 contracts volume (high liquidity), yes ask = 25 → implied yes = 25% (no = 80%). Closes 2026-02-02T04:59:00Z. Research findings & edge thesis: Billboard Hot 100 positions are deterministically measurable from streaming/airplay/sales data released weekly; chart timing is public and major outlets publish chart previews and tracking throughout the week. Because the market is pricing ~25% for Aperture to reach #1 despite strong streaming debuts commonly observed for major artists, there is potential to research streaming platform daily ranks, radio adds, and sales estimates during the chart week to find short-term information asymmetry.
