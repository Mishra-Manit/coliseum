# Will the government be shut down on January 31?

**Outcome**: Yes

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Market data: 1-cent spread, 9,253,906 contracts volume (very deep liquidity), yes ask = 74 → implied yes = 74% (no = 27%). Closes 2026-01-31T15:00:00Z. Research findings & edge thesis: The shutdown market is highly liquid and reflects current appropriations negotiation expectations; however appropriations progress (bill text, House/Senate votes, and bipartisan statements) and the timing of CRs/omnibus consideration are public and can change quickly. Given the market’s strong lean toward a shutdown, concentrated legislative tracking (schedules, whip counts, leadership statements) could uncover short-term mispricing if a last-minute deal emerges.

## Research Synthesis

Researched Questions

- What are the historical base rates and recent precedents for U.S. federal government shutdowns that are most relevant to a Jan 31, 2026 funding deadline? 
- What is the current legislative/administrative status of FY2026 appropriations and any continuing resolution(s) that control funding through Jan 30–31, 2026? 
- What public statements, caucus positions, and procedural hurdles (filibuster/60-vote thresholds, unanimous consent, House schedule) are on the record and could determine whether DHS funding is included or stripped before the deadline? 
- Which last‑minute procedural or political paths exist to avert a shutdown (short CR, split passage of bills, unanimous consent) and what historical examples show how quickly those can succeed or fail?

Research Synthesis

Event overview

- Background: Congress enacted a continuing appropriations measure in November 2025 that, in part, provided short‑term funding into January 2026. The Congressional Research Service states that Division A of P.L. 119‑37 “provides continuing appropriations through January 30, 2026.” (CRS summary of P.L. 119‑37). This means that, absent new action, funding authority provided by that CR expires at the end of January 30, 2026 and a funding lapse could take effect after the expiration window. (Congress.gov / CRS).

- Immediate trigger: In late January 2026, a political standoff emerged around inclusion of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding in a multi‑bill package. Several Senate Democrats publicly said on the record they would refuse to advance any package that contains the current DHS language after public outrage over recent ICE/CBP shootings in Minneapolis. CBS News summarized the Senate leader’s statement: “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

Key drivers and dependencies

- Base rates and recent precedent: CRS and Congress.gov maintain historical tracking and FAQs showing that funding gaps and shutdowns are recurring features of the appropriations cycle and can be resolved quickly or drag on for weeks. The same CRS CR that extended funding in November 2025 noted that it ended a 42‑day lapse earlier in FY2026. That recent multi‑week shutdown (Oct–Nov 2025) is a close precedent for how entrenched disagreements can require multi‑step compromise to resolve. (CRS summary: “The enactment of P.L. 119‑37 ended a 42‑day lapse in appropriations.”)

- Senate math and procedure: The upper chamber’s procedures are pivotal. Because the Senate typically needs 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles and advance major consolidated spending measures, a unified minority can block a bundled package that contains a disputed DHS title. Several contemporaneous reports cite Senate leadership statements and rank‑and‑file senators publicly refusing to back DHS funding as packaged, implying the Senate cannot clear the minibus without some Democratic votes. That makes the Senate schedule and whip counts critical.

- House schedule and mechanics: The House has passed a package that includes DHS language and is in recess after passing it; if the Senate amends or strips DHS language, the House may need to reconvene to concur. The timing and willingness of House leadership to bring up revised language (or to accept a split strategy) is a determinant of whether a last‑minute fix can be enacted.

Counterpoints and evidence that could avert a shutdown

- Procedural workarounds exist and have been used: Senators have the option to separate contentious components (pass five bills quickly, hold DHS for later), pass a short technical continuing resolution, or seek unanimous consent to change the package. Media reporting and congressional negotiator statements show negotiators discussing splitting DHS from other bills or fast‑tracking the non‑DHS bills to keep most of government funded.

- Recent bipartisan deals and votes earlier in FY2026: The Senate in November 2025 passed a measure that included continuing appropriations and full‑year bills by division. That history establishes that bipartisan, omnibus/minibus compromises are achievable when negotiators can secure holdouts. Press coverage in recent days recorded senators and negotiators publicly discussing paths to advance five of the six bills before the deadline.

Counterpoints and risks that push toward a shutdown

- Sudden political shock: The Minneapolis shooting(s) and the immediate public and caucus backlash have hardened positions. Major Senate Democrats, including leadership, issued statements refusing to support the DHS language as it stands; multiple outlets reported Schumer’s public “I will vote no” line and senators from both Minnesota and other states signaling opposition. That kind of immediate political hardening can remove the Democratic votes the Senate negotiations were relying on.

- Procedural friction and calendar constraints: If the Senate needs 60 votes to proceed, and some Republicans are not willing to carve DHS out of the minibus without unanimous consent, the clock can run out. House recess and logistic friction (reconvene timing, conference steps, or reconciliation of differences) make last‑minute passage harder than simple vote counting suggests.

Timeline and decision points (explicit, with dates)

- January 30, 2026: The continuing appropriations language currently on the books (P.L. 119‑37 Division A) funds specified agencies through January 30, 2026. If no new authority is enacted that extends or replaces that CR, funding authority lapses after that date (the practical shutdown window begins as the CR expires at midnight/early hours after Jan 30 depending on how enactment language is written and OMB guidance).

- January 30–31, 2026 (through market close): Last‑minute procedural maneuvers (Senate cloture votes, unanimous consent requests, Senate votes to strip or split DHS from package, House reconvening and votes) are the proximate decision points. Any public whip‑count changes, recorded roll calls, or an agreed text posted to Congress.gov and announced by leadership in the 24–72 hours before Jan 30 are the immediate catalysts that would change market pricing.

What would change the outlook (signals to watch)

- Public whip counts / roll call intentions: Statements by swing senators announcing support or opposition in the next 72 hours (e.g., floor statements, press releases, or recorded votes) would materially change the legislative math. 

- Formal Senate maneuvers: A Senate procedural move to separate DHS, a unanimous‑consent agreement to pass five bills, or a filed cloture motion with announced Democratic votes would be decisive operational signals.

- House calendar actions: A House leadership announcement to reconvene with a specific vote time to accept Senate changes (or to concur in Senate amending language) would remove a major logistical barrier.

- Court or agency actions are unlikely to change the need for a new appropriation before the CR expiration; OMB guidance and agency shutdown plans could mitigate operational effects but do not replace the need for enacted appropriations.

Summary (neutral)

- The legal baseline is clear: current CR language provides funding only through January 30, 2026 unless Congress enacts a new statute. Recent public statements from Senate Democrats (leadership included) opposing the packaged DHS funding are the principal near‑term political barrier to enactment. Procedural pathways exist to avoid a full funding lapse (split passage, short CR, unanimous consent) but require either quick bipartisan agreement or an operational willingness by one chamber to change the package and timing. Historical precedent shows both quick last‑minute fixes and multi‑week stalemates are possible; the October–November 2025 42‑day lapse is the most recent proximate precedent and demonstrates how disputes over a single title can cascade.

### Reasoning

Evidence quality is solid but not exhaustive. Sources are credible and diverse (CRS/Congress.gov, AP, CBS, WaPo, Guardian) and very recent. The research clearly outlines legal baselines, Senate/House procedural constraints, and the DHS-related political shock. However, it lacks hard whip counts, concrete floor timing, and posted bill text, leaving key uncertainties on speed/feasibility of workarounds (split bills, short CR, UC). Recent precedent of a 42‑day lapse elevates shutdown risk, but last‑minute CRs remain plausible. Given these mixed signals, I estimate YES at 71%, near market. Edge <5% and expected value negative at current price; Kelly sizing for YES rounds to 0%. Confidence is moderate (~60%).
