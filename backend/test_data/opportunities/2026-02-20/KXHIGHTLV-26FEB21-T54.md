# Will the maximum temperature be  <54° on Feb 21, 2026?

**Outcome**: 53° or below

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: Market pricing implies NO at 96% (NO ask 96¢) for “max temp <54°” in Las Vegas on Feb 21, 2026, suggesting max temp is expected to be 54° or higher with a small remaining tail risk. Supporting evidence: tight 1¢ spread (NO bid/ask 95/96) and meaningful liquidity (volume 1,233; open interest 416) indicate stable consensus into close. Resolution source: official observed maximum temperature for Las Vegas as reported by NOAA/NWS (e.g., NWS Las Vegas station data / climate reports). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable to observed weather data ✓; stable inputs (short-horizon forecast/observation) ✓. Risk level: LOW (weather can shift, but market consensus + imminent observation makes reversal risk comparatively small vs other non-weather candidates; selected as lowest-risk available after excluding forbidden crypto/parlay markets). Remaining risks: last-minute forecast error or station measurement nuance. Sources: https://www.weather.gov/vef/ ; https://www.noaa.gov/ ; https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked whether the determining event is still pending and whether there’s any credible mechanism for an “official reversal.” Web searches for NWS/NOAA Las Vegas *daily climate reports* / *observed maximum temperature* for **Feb 21, 2026** did not surface any official observed max-temp record yet (which is expected because **Feb 21, 2026 is tomorrow** relative to today, **Feb 20, 2026**), meaning the event has **not occurred** and cannot be “reversed” because it hasn’t been recorded. ([yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/warm-temperatures-hold-steady-rest-161327381.html?utm_source=openai))

I also looked for any indication that NWS/NOAA temperature observations are subject to appeals/recounts analogous to elections/sports; nothing credible suggests a formal appeal process that could flip a finalized observed high—resolution is typically a posted station maximum once the day completes. The only real showstopper flip mechanism would be if the market’s resolution station/source is misidentified (e.g., confusion with “Las Vegas Municipal” in NM vs Las Vegas, NV), but that’s a market-definition/data-source risk rather than an appeal/reversal. ([tgftp.nws.noaa.gov](https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/weather/current/KLVS.html?utm_source=openai))

**No confirmed appeal/reversal or corrected-bad-info event was found; the only flip risk is that the deciding observation is still pending until Feb 21 completes.**

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO (per research). Confidence: HIGH, as no credible appeal/reversal mechanism was found—only the underlying weather observation is still pending until the day completes.
