# What will Bernie Sanders say during A Townhall w/ Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna?

**Outcome**: Trump

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: Market is priced at ~93% YES (YES ask 93c / NO ask 9c), indicating a near-consensus outcome within the remaining time window. Supporting evidence: tight spread (2c) with substantial volume/open interest suggests stable pricing and low probability of a late swing relative to other non-banned options in this dataset. Resolution source: Kalshi market rules for the event (Kalshi determines settlement based on the specified transcript/recording criteria for what is said during the townhall). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; stable inputs (single scheduled event, no complex dependencies) ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable ✓. Reversal risk: LOW (selected as least-risky available NON-banned candidate; weather/crypto markets were excluded by strategy rules, and "previously discovered" NBA mention market was not eligible). Remaining risks: wording ambiguity in what counts as an utterance/mention per rules, or event cancellation/coverage issues. Sources: https://kalshi.com/markets/KXBERNIEMENTION-26FEB21

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for whether the referenced “A Townhall w/ Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna” is still upcoming vs already occurred, and for any explicit cancellation/postponement notices, plus how the market’s resolution source works (Kalshi rulebook/contract rules references). The most directly relevant listing I found is a Stanford Speakers Bureau event describing a *private townhall* with Sanders and Khanna on **February 20, 2026** (today), with fixed door open/close times—suggesting the determining event is scheduled imminently (and could already be in progress/complete depending on time). ([stanfordspeakersbureau.com](https://stanfordspeakersbureau.com/events/townhall?utm_source=openai)) I did **not** find any credible report that the townhall has been cancelled or postponed.

No official “appeal” mechanism seems applicable here; settlement would hinge on the existence/availability of the qualifying transcript/recording per Kalshi’s published rules framework, and I did not find any correction indicating the market was based on false information. ([kalshi.com](https://kalshi.com/regulatory/rulebook?utm_source=openai)) Therefore, I see **no showstopper, complete-reversal risk** beyond the narrow edge case of the event not occurring as scheduled or the official recording/transcript criteria not being met.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research found no credible cancellation/postponement or rule/settlement showstopper; remaining issues are only minor wording/coverage edge cases rather than a true flip risk.
