# What will the announcers say during Los Angeles C vs Los Angeles L Professional Basketball Game?

**Outcome**: Injury / Injured

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This is the lowest-risk non-banned option in the provided universe because most other 92–96% markets are explicitly banned categories (weather/crypto/celebrity release). Supporting Evidence: Market is pricing YES at ~94% (yes_ask 94c) with tight spread (3c), indicating a near-consensus that the phrase will be mentioned during the broadcast. Resolution Source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules for the event (based on the game broadcast/announcer audio per the rulebook). Risk checklist: clear resolution source (Kalshi rules) ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable for this type of market ✓; stable inputs (broadcast occurs once; outcome determined by transcript) ✓. Risk level: MODERATE (forced fallback selection as least-risky available non-banned market, but still subject to subjectivity in what counts as an 'injury' mention and the possibility it is never said). Remaining risks: announcers may not say the exact keyword or audio/transcript interpretation dispute. Sources: https://kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked (1) whether the underlying determining event is still pending (the Lakers–Clippers game/broadcast) and (2) whether Kalshi’s “announcers say” *Injury / Injured* contracts have any unusual resolution/appeal mechanics that could later reverse an obvious outcome. The game is scheduled for **Friday, Feb 20, 2026 (10:00 PM ET)**, so the determining event has **not yet occurred** as of now, meaning the market can still “flip” in the ordinary sense if announcers never say the exact keyword. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401810664&utm_source=openai))

On rules: a publicly visible Kalshi listing for an analogous NBA “Injury / Injured” mentions market states the **exact word (including plural/possessive) must be spoken** by play-by-play or color commentators during the game window; video is used first, then transcripts if needed. That creates a real path to a NO resolution if “injury/injured” is never said or if wording differs (e.g., “hurt,” “banged up”). ([coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/predictions/event/KXNBAMENTION-26FEB22CLEOKC?utm_source=openai))

No explicit appeals/reversals were found—resolution risk is mainly **the event hasn’t happened yet + exact-word requirement**, not a post-hoc reversal.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → proceed with HIGH confidence. Research found no special post-hoc reversal/appeal mechanism; main uncertainty is ordinary pre-event variability (whether the exact word is spoken), not a flip-risk factor.
