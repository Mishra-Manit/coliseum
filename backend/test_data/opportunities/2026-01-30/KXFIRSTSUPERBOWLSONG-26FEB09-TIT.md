# Will Tití Me Preguntó be the first song performed by Bad Bunny during the 2026 Pro Football Championship halftime show?

**Outcome**: Tití Me Preguntó

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: Current market price: YES = 0.44 (market assigns ~44% probability Tití Me Preguntó will be the first song). Research findings: Apple Music/NFL promotional trailer and multiple news outlets highlight 'BAILE INoLVIDABLE' in the official Super Bowl halftime trailer (the trailer explicitly uses Baile Inolvidable footage), while recent Bad Bunny tour setlists from January 2026 (Ticketmaster / JamBase listings) show the typical main-stage openers are 'LA Mu D ANZA' or 'BAILE INoLVIDABLE', with 'Tití me preguntó' appearing later on the La Casita stage. These public setlist patterns and the trailer's focus on 'BAILE INoLVIDABLE' suggest Tití is less likely to be the opener than the market currently prices. Repricing catalyst: when rehearsal reports or setlist leaks (commonly appear 2–7 days before the show) surface, the market should reprice quickly; Apple Music/NFL or reliable setlist leaks would be decisive. Confidence: Medium.

## Research Synthesis

### Researched Questions
- Does the official Apple Music / NFL promotional trailer for Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show use the song “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” or other footage that signals which song(s) are being highlighted for the halftime performance?
- What do Bad Bunny’s recent (January 2026) tour setlists show about which songs open the main stage versus which songs appear later or on secondary stages (specifically: placement of "Tití Me Preguntó", "BAILE INoLVIDABLE", and "LA MuDANZA")?
- What is the historical behavior around Super Bowl halftime setlist leaks and rehearsal reporting (timing and reliability)? How often do rehearsals or leaks appear in the days leading up to the show?
- How strong is the counter-evidence that the artist might change normal tour ordering for a special event (i.e., could Tití be promoted to opener despite recent tour patterns)?

## Research Synthesis

### Event Overview
This market asks whether Bad Bunny will open the Apple Music–produced Super Bowl LX halftime show with the song "Tití Me Preguntó." The official trailer released by Apple Music and circulated by major outlets on Jan 16–19, 2026 features Bad Bunny dancing in Puerto Rico while the track labeled/identified in coverage is "BAILE INoLVIDABLE." The Super Bowl itself is scheduled for Feb 8, 2026 (local date), and the market close listed for the prediction market is 2026-02-09T04:59:00+00:00 (provided opportunity metadata).

Sources documenting the trailer’s soundtrack and imagery are consistent across outlets: Apple Music’s trailer uses audio/footage associated with "BAILE INoLVIDABLE," and press coverage (Apple-focused and mainstream outlets) explicitly call out that song in the trailer.

### Key Drivers
- Trailer emphasis: Multiple news stories and press writeups cite the Apple Music trailer and note that it opens with or prominently features "BAILE INoLVIDABLE." That placement in promotional material is a direct indicator of what Apple/Music production is choosing to visually and sonically highlight in the lead-up to the show.
- Recent tour setlist pattern: independent setlist reports (JamBase summaries and Ticketmaster setlist listings for January 2026 shows) show a repeated two-stage structure on Bad Bunny’s DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS world tour: a Main Stage sequence that begins with "LA MuDANZA" and includes "BAILE INoLVIDABLE" early on, and a secondary stage labeled "La Casita" where "Tití Me Preguntó" is performed later in the show. Multiple Jan 2026 concert reports (Lima, Medellín and other dates) show the same pattern: "LA MuDANZA" as a main-stage opener, "BAILE INoLVIDABLE" main-stage early, and "Tití Me Preguntó" located on the La Casita run that follows the initial main-stage block.
- Precedent for promo/trailer signaling setlist choices: Using a song in an official trailer suggests the production wants to associate that track with the halftime show’s identity; production teams typically highlight the song(s) they plan to feature or that fit the show’s theme.

### Counterpoints and Risks
- Setlists are not immutable: high-profile halftime shows undergo many iterations. Reporting about Rihanna’s 2023 halftime preparations documents dozens of setlist drafts and last‑minute changes, indicating the final televised order can differ from tour patterns or rehearsed drafts. This demonstrates material uncertainty up to the last rehearsal cycles.
- Leaks and rehearsal audio have occurred very close to the show: reporting around the 2025 Super Bowl (Kendrick Lamar) documents an alleged leak of rehearsal audio/setlist the day before the show and public discussion of legal action to contain leaks. Insider comments from crew members (public AMA-style posts) note that core staging and many details can be known by crews several days in advance. These examples show that the reliable public signal that typically forces re-pricing (a rehearsal leak or credible report) can appear within 1–4 days of the event in practice.
- Promotional material can be misdirection: a trailer’s use of one song ("BAILE INoLVIDABLE") could be thematic rather than literally the opening performance—artists and producers sometimes use a representative track for promotional purposes even if the televised opening differs.

### Timeline (key dates and decision points)
- Jan 16–19, 2026: Apple Music / NFL released official trailer featuring "BAILE INoLVIDABLE" (press coverage dated Jan 16–19 noted in sources).
- Jan 10–25, 2026: Multiple tour dates (examples: Jan 17 Lima; Jan 25 Medellín) show the two-stage setlist pattern with "LA MuDANZA" / "BAILE INoLVIDABLE" on the Main Stage and "Tití Me Preguntó" on La Casita.
- Feb 1–8, 2026 (week of the game): typical window for rehearsals at the venue. Historical leaks and reporting show that credible rehearsal audio or setlist leaks have surfaced as early as one day before a halftime show and that crew/stage staff can know much earlier (several days) internally. If a public rehearsal report or a leak appears, it would likely be published 1–7 days before Feb 8 and would be the strongest near-term repricing catalyst.
- Market close: 2026-02-09T04:59:00+00:00 (opportunity metadata).

### Information Gaps
- There are no publicly available credible rehearsal reports or confirmed leaks for Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show at the time of this research (Jan 30, 2026). I found no confirmed rehearsal setlists for Levi’s Stadium that specify the first televised song. 
- Official production statements listing the halftime show song order have not been released; the trailer is the strongest official media asset but is not a formal setlist.
- While multiple January 2026 tour setlists are reported by outlets aggregating setlists (JamBase, Ticketmaster listings citing setlist.fm), there is no authoritative confirmation that the broadcast halftime show will adopt the tour’s two-stage configuration intact (production adjustments for television are common).

## Balanced Evidence Summary (bulleted)
- Evidence suggesting Tití Me Preguntó is less likely to be the opener: (1) official trailer audio highlights "BAILE INoLVIDABLE"; (2) multiple Jan 2026 tour setlists show main-stage openers are "LA MuDANZA" and early main-stage placement for "BAILE INoLVIDABLE", while "Tití Me Preguntó" appears on the La Casita segment later in the set.
- Evidence leaving open the possibility of Tití as opener: (1) halftime shows frequently iterate setlists and make last-minute changes; (2) promotional choices can be thematic and not definitive; (3) rehearsal leaks or reports—when they appear—have historically sometimes surfaced within 1–4 days of the show, which can override prior pattern evidence.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** | -5% | -11% | 0.0% |
| **NO** | +3% | +5% | 1.8% |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Evidence quality: Medium—credible, recent sources (Apple Music/NFL trailer coverage, JamBase/Ticketmaster setlists) with multiple independent outlets, but no rehearsal leaks. The trailer spotlights “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” and Jan 2026 setlists show La Mudanza/Baile as main-stage openers, with “Tití Me Preguntó” typically on a later La Casita segment, pushing YES probability below market. Offsetting factors: halftime productions often reorder songs, trailers can be thematic, and last‑minute changes are common. No authoritative setlist yet. Result: estimated YES p=0.39 vs price 0.44. Flag: Insufficient edge for YES at current price. Confidence: Medium.
