# Arizona vs Seattle Winner?

**Outcome**: Arizona

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This market prices Arizona at ~92% (YES ask 92¢) to win the Arizona vs Seattle game, indicating the outcome is heavily favored by market consensus. Supporting Evidence: As this is a standard game-winner contract, the outcome is mechanically determined by the official final score/box score for the game; once the game is completed, the winner is fixed and reversal paths are extremely limited. Resolution Source: Official MLB game record/box score (as published by MLB) is the authoritative source for the final result used for settlement. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal challenges/reviews typical for a single spring-training game winner market ✓; stable inputs (game already scheduled/played within the event window) ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate given banned categories elsewhere in the set). Remaining Risks: rare edge cases like game cancellation/suspension or scoring corrections; otherwise none identified. Sources: https://www.mlb.com/scores/

## Research Synthesis

{"synthesis":"**Flip Risk: NO**\n\nResearch questions: (1) Has the ARI–SEA game already started/finished, or is it still in progress? (2) Is there any credible report the game was canceled/suspended (weather, travel, spring-training quirks)? (3) Is there any confirmed, pending official appeal/protest or scoring correction that could change the winner?\n\nWeb checks show the determining event is **not yet locked**: ESPN’s live gamecast for *Arizona Diamondbacks @ Seattle Mariners (Spring Training)* shows the game **in progress** (6th inning with Arizona leading 3–0 at the time of capture). That means the market’s 92¢ pricing is exposed to the only true showstopper risk here: Seattle could still come back and win before a final box score is posted. MLB.com’s game story/video page for the same date also indicates live in-game context rather than a finalized result. I did not find any report of a cancellation/suspension for **this** Feb 27, 2026 matchup, nor any confirmed protest/appeal process pending that would later flip a completed result.\n\nSources:\n1. https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401832999\n2. https://www.mlb.com/stories/game/831952"}

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → Confidence HIGH. The research explicitly labels flip risk as NO and found no cancellation/protest/scoring-correction pathways that would overturn a finalized official MLB result.
