# Will Trump say "Turning Point" before Mar 1, 2026?

**Outcome**: Turning Point

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This market is priced at ~96% for NO (i.e., Trump does not say “Turning Point” before the Mar 1, 2026 cutoff), implying the market considers the outcome near-decided. Supporting Evidence: time window remaining is short (market closes 2026-03-01T15:00:00Z) and the priced probability leaves only ~4% for a late mention, matching the SURE THING profile. Resolution Source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules based on verifiable public records of Trump’s remarks/appearances within the stated window. Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no active formal appeals/judicial reviews identified ✓; stable inputs (either he says the exact phrase or not) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as lowest-risk available given bans on weather/crypto markets and lack of confirmed sports results in-scan). Remaining risks: unexpected late mention in a speech/interview before cutoff; ambiguity over what counts as “saying” the phrase under rules. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I researched (1) whether Trump has already said the exact phrase “Turning Point” during the market window, and (2) how Kalshi “mention/said a word” markets typically resolve (i.e., what sources count and whether that can override obvious video evidence). A widely circulated official transcript on the Senate Democratic Caucus site includes Trump saying “Turning Point” multiple times (in context of “Turning Point”/“Turning Point USA”), indicating the determining event *may already have occurred* (which would make a “complete flip” plausible if the market is still pricing NO). ([democrats.senate.gov](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/trump-transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-signs-a-memorandum-to-deploy-troops-in-memphis-tennessee-91525?utm_source=openai)) 

However, a key showstopper risk is **resolution-source constraints**: Kalshi mention markets can be resolved based only on “approved outlets,” and if the qualifying source set doesn’t document the phrase, contracts can resolve NO even when attendee video suggests YES (as reported for a Feb 12, 2026 Sanders rally). ([defirate.com](https://defirate.com/prediction-markets/mention-markets/?utm_source=openai)) 

Net: **No confirmed appeal/reversal process is evident**; the only credible flip risk is that the phrase appears in a qualifying official/approved record (or already did), which would deterministically swing resolution to YES.
