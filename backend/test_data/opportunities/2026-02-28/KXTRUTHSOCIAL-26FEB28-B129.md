# Will Donald Trump make between 120 and 139 Truth Social posts the week of Feb 22, 2026?

**Outcome**: 120-139

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: With the counting window essentially complete (week of Feb 22, 2026) and this being a purely mechanical tally of Truth Social posts, the market is pricing a NO at ~96% (implying the observed total is very likely outside 120–139). Supporting Evidence: time window has ended and only the final, verifiable post count matters; with <48 hours to close there is minimal scope for the underlying count to change. Resolution Source: Kalshi resolves using archived/public Truth Social post records for the specified week (platform record as the authoritative source). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal challenges/appeals path (a social media post count is not subject to litigation) ✓; stable inputs (historical record) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as lowest-risk available from this dataset). Remaining risks: minor ambiguity if Truth Social deletes/restores posts or if Kalshi’s counting methodology (e.g., reposts vs posts) differs from third-party trackers.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for the contract’s *mechanical* resolution rules (what counts as a “post,” whether deletions matter, and when the count is recorded) and for any indication the observation window is still pending or contestable. Comparable Kalshi/Coinbase “Trump Truth Social posts this week” markets state the observation period ends at **11:59 PM ET** on the final day, the post count is recorded at **10:00 AM ET the next day**, includes **Truths, ReTruths, and Quote Truths**, and **excludes posts deleted as of expiration**—with Roll Call as primary verifier. citeturn0search0turn1search0 That structure implies the determining event (the week’s posting activity) is already fixed, and only a pre-defined tally remains.

The only credible showstopper would be a *rule/source change* after the fact or the event not yet having ended; I did not find any official notice that this week’s window is uncounted/pending or under appeal. The main residual risk is definitional (e.g., deletions/withholding on Truth Social can occur), but that is already addressed in rules (“deleted…will not be included”), so it’s not a true reversal path. citeturn1search0turn0search5

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research indicates the observation window is fixed and resolution is mechanical with defined counting rules; residual definitional/deletion nuances are acknowledged but not a credible reversal path.
