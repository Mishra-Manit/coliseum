INFO:__main__:Query: What are experts saying about inflation in 2026?
INFO:__main__:Answer: Experts generally anticipate that inflation in 2026 will moderate, with projections indicating a decline from higher levels seen in previous years. Goldman Sachs forecasts core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation falling to approximately 2.1% by December 2026, reflecting a stabilization near the Federal Reserve's target rate ([Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/us-gdp-growth-is-projected-to-outperform-economist-forecasts-in-2026)). Similarly, J.P. Morgan expects CPI inflation to rise modestly from 2.8% in July 2025 to around 3.5% by the end of 2025, before drifting back down to 2.8% by late 2026 ([J.P. Morgan](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates)). Goldman Sachs' broader outlook for 2026 also highlights a global easing of inflation from 4.2% in 2025 to approximately 3.7%, with the U.S. following a similar trend ([Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/global-inflation-forecasts-by-country-in-2026)). 

While some sources, like Investopedia, note that inflation may remain "sticky" due to persistent services inflation, the consensus among financial institutions suggests a downward trajectory toward the Fed's 2% target ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/will-inflation-finally-cool-in-2026-here-s-what-economists-expect-11863122)). Economists also acknowledge that inflation could be influenced by factors such as tariff reductions, fiscal policies, and global economic conditions, which are expected to ease inflationary pressures. Overall, the prevailing expert view as of early 2026 is that inflation will decline, providing some relief to consumers, though it may not fall as quickly or as low as some would hope, with sticky services inflation potentially keeping core measures above 2% for part of the year ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economy-2026-outlook-affordability-rates-jobs-markets)).
