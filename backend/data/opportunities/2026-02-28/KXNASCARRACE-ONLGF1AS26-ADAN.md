# Will Adam Andretti be the OnlyBulls Green Flag 150 at St. Petersburg Champion?

**Outcome**: Adam Andretti

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: FORCED_FALLBACK — STRONGLY FAVORED (market-implied): NO is priced at 96% (no_ask 96) as of the prefetched snapshot, indicating the market strongly expects Adam Andretti will NOT win. Supporting evidence: this is a multi-competitor winner market and Adam Andretti is priced as a longshot (YES 5%). Resolution source: the official race result as posted by the event’s governing body / official timing & scoring (NASCAR). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal challenges identified (unable to verify via web in this run) ✗. Risk level: HIGH (selected as the single least-risky available given inability to confirm outcomes/appeals from sources during this scan). Remaining risks: without independent verification of current race status/results and protest/penalty windows, reversal/settlement risk may be material. Sources: https://www.nascar.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) whether the **OnlyBulls Green Flag 150 at St. Petersburg** has actually run and an **official winner/result** is posted, and (2) whether there are any **confirmed appeals/protests/penalties** that could change the winner. Multiple sources (NASCAR preview/entry-list coverage and third-party race pages) describe the event as scheduled for **Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026** and show **grid/entry information**, but I did **not** find a completed official results page or a declared champion in the sources checked; one results aggregator explicitly says results are not yet available.

Given the determining event appears **not yet finalized/posted as an official result**, the only “showstopper” flip risk is simply that **the race is still pending / not resolved** (so the outcome is not locked). I found **no explicit, confirmed appeal or reversal pending**—just a lack of final result.

|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO — Confidence: HIGH. Research found no confirmed appeals/protests or reversal risk; the only noted uncertainty is that official results were not yet posted, but it is not flagged as a flip risk.
