# Will Trump say "Turning Point" before Mar 1, 2026?

**Outcome**: Turning Point

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: With the market near 96% for NO (Trump will not say the exact phrase "Turning Point" before the Mar 1, 2026 cutoff), this is priced as a near-decided outcome. Supporting evidence: the contract requires an exact-phrase utterance within a very short remaining window (~35 hours from 2026-02-28T03:34Z to 2026-03-01T15:00Z), and absent a scheduled event explicitly featuring the phrase, the base rate for a specific two-word phrase is low. Resolution source: Kalshi resolution based on public recordings/transcripts of Trump’s public remarks and posts per market rules. Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable ✓; stable inputs (only an utterance can flip outcome) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate given other prefetched markets are weather/crypto (banned) or race-winner markets (high variance)). Remaining risks: Trump could say the phrase in a speech/interview/post before the deadline. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) any *upcoming* Trump events between **Feb 28–Mar 1, 2026 (UTC)** where the exact phrase **“Turning Point”** would be likely to appear, and (2) any evidence he has *already* said or posted “Turning Point” in this window. I found coverage and transcripts around major recent remarks (notably his **Feb 24, 2026 State of the Union** transcript publications) with no indication this market’s target phrase was said there, and I did not find credible reporting/transcripts showing he has said “Turning Point” on Feb 28, 2026. 

The only real way for the outcome to flip is if Trump delivers a public remark or post before the **Mar 1, 2026 15:00 UTC** cutoff that contains the exact phrase; I found no confirmed scheduled event in that remaining window that makes this likely. No official appeals/reversals are applicable—resolution depends on the existence of a verifiable mention.
