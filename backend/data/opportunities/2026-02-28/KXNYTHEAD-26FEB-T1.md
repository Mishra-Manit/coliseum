# Will the number of full-width New York Times front page headlines be above 1 in Feb 2026?

**Outcome**: At least 2

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: CONFIRMED (structurally locked): February 2026 includes 28 total print days; the market asks whether the count of days with at least two full-width NYT front-page headlines is above 1 (i.e., ≥2 such days). By Feb 28, 2026 (with Feb complete), the outcome is effectively fixed by the NYT print front pages already published; only tabulation remains. Supporting evidence: once the month ends, the count cannot change—only verification of the archived front pages is needed; market is priced at NO 93¢ (implying ~93%). Resolution source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules using NYT front page archives (publisher print/PDF archive) and/or Kalshi’s specified data source. Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓, stable inputs after month-end ✓, no formal challenges likely ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate in this dataset). Remaining risks: minor—definition/measurement of “full-width headline” per Kalshi rules could create edge-case ambiguity, but no external appeals pathway.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked whether the determining event is still pending or could be revised: February 2026 has ended (Feb 1–Feb 28), so the set of NYT print front pages that could contain “full-width” headlines is already fixed; only counting/classification per the market’s definition remains. I also searched for anything indicating an official appeal/reversal pathway or a correction that would change the underlying record (e.g., NYT front-page archive changes, Kalshi rule amendments specific to this market), and found only that multiple third-party archives and the NYT “Today’s Paper”/front-page ecosystem exist to verify what printed on each date.

The only credible way to “completely flip” would be if the market’s determining event were not actually locked (e.g., it resolves using a source that is incomplete/not yet published for some February dates) or if Kalshi explicitly revised the contract’s definition/source after the fact—neither is confirmed from what I found. No showstopper reversal/appeal is evidenced.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research indicates the underlying February 2026 NYT front pages are already fixed (month complete) and no credible reversal/appeal pathway or post hoc rule/source change was found.
