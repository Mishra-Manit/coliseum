# Will Layne Riggs be the OnlyBulls Green Flag 150 at St. Petersburg Champion?

**Outcome**: Layne Riggs

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: Market is pricing “NO” at ~95% (NO ask 95¢), implying Layne Riggs will not win this race. Supporting evidence: this is a single-winner motorsport event with many competitors; a single named driver priced at 5–6% to win indicates a heavily favored NO side with limited time remaining before close (closes 2026-02-28 23:00 UTC). Resolution source: official race classification from the sanctioning body/event organizers (e.g., NASCAR/track timing & scoring). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no known formal appeals/reviews typical for immediate race results ✓; stable inputs (event concludes before close) ✓. Risk level: LOW; selected as the single lowest-reversal-risk available candidate given dataset constraints and Tier exclusions (avoided crypto and speaking markets). Remaining risks: post-race penalties/disqualifications could change winner, but such reversals are uncommon and typically resolved quickly. Sources: https://www.nascar.com/results/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

Searched for (1) whether the OnlyBulls Green Flag 150 at St. Petersburg has already produced official results, (2) whether NASCAR has posted a final classification/leaderboard, and (3) whether there are any confirmed reviews/appeals that could later change the winner. NASCAR’s live-results page for the event shows “Live Now” with no leaderboard data populated, indicating the race outcome is not finalized/posted yet (i.e., determining event appears still pending). citeturn1search3 Additional pages found (entry list, schedule/preview, and third-party listings) discuss the event as occurring on Feb 28, 2026 but do not provide an official final classification. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search4 

Given there is no official final result posted in the primary resolution source (NASCAR) at the time checked, there is no showstopper “reversal” scenario to evaluate yet; the only credible way the market could “flip” is simply that Layne Riggs wins once the race is actually run/confirmed.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → Confidence HIGH. Research indicates no official final result is posted yet and no active appeals/reviews; the main way this could flip is simply if Layne Riggs wins when the race is run.
