# Will Donald Trump make between 120 and 139 Truth Social posts the week of Feb 22, 2026?

**Outcome**: 120-139

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: The market is priced at NO ≈ 96% (YES ask 5¢ / NO ask 96¢), implying the count is very likely NOT to land in the 120–139 band by the contract’s measurement window. Supporting Evidence: This is a bounded, short-horizon count market with the measurement window ending before close (week of Feb 22, 2026), so remaining uncertainty is limited to a finite number of posts and typical late-count corrections. Resolution Source: Kalshi’s resolution is based on the official Truth Social posting record per its market rules (counting posts during the specified week). Risk Checklist: clear resolution source identified ✓; no formal appeals/reviews expected ✓; stable inputs (post count cannot change after the window ends) ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as lowest-reversal-risk available given dataset constraints; other 92–96% markets are weather/crypto/speaking or race-winner markets with higher swing risk). Remaining Risks: Minor—possible ambiguity in what qualifies as a “post” under the market rules or late data corrections, but no formal appeal pathway typically exists.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked how these Kalshi “Truth Social posts this week” contracts are typically defined and resolved, focusing on whether the determining event is still pending, whether a formal appeal/reversal is in flight, or whether the market could have been priced off incorrect rules. Kalshi’s own contract descriptions (via Kalshi-powered listings) specify a fixed observation window (12:00 AM ET start through 11:59 PM ET end) and a later, mechanical “post count recorded” timestamp (often 10:00 AM ET the next day), with Truths/ReTruths/Quote Truths included and deletions by expiration excluded—so once the week ends, the underlying posting activity can’t “flip,” only the final recorded count could be adjusted within the rules. citeturn0search1turn1search1

The only credible reversal mechanism would be an explicit, pending dispute/appeal over the final count or a change/correction in the resolution source (e.g., Roll Call capture rules), but I did not find any confirmed, ongoing appeal specific to the Feb 22–Feb 28, 2026 week or this 120–139 bracket. Discussions of confusion about “event window vs. market expiration” exist, but they describe interpretation issues rather than a confirmed reversal process. citeturn1reddit15turn0reddit12

No showstopper flip risk is evident.

| **YES** |  |  |  |

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research indicates a fixed observation window with no confirmed pending dispute/appeal, so reversal risk appears minimal.
