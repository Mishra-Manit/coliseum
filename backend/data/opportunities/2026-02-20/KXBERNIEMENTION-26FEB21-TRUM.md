# What will Bernie Sanders say during A Townhall w/ Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna?

**Outcome**: Trump

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This is a keyword-mention market where “Trump” is an extremely likely topic given Sanders’ repeated, recent public remarks framed explicitly around President Trump. Supporting evidence: Sanders’ official prepared remarks responding to President Trump’s congressional address (March 4, 2025) repeatedly reference “President Trump/Donald Trump,” indicating high base-rate likelihood of mentioning Trump in a political townhall format; additionally, the townhall event is publicly described as a political discussion about “Who Controls the Future of AI,” a context where Trump-era policy and critique are commonly raised. Resolution source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules/verification source specified in the contract (platform rules framework). Risk checklist: clear resolution source identified ✓; strong position via high base-rate/likely topic ✓; no formal challenges/appeals applicable to a real-time speech mention market ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available non-banned market in this dataset, given many alternatives are banned categories like weather/crypto or inherently high-variance winners). Remaining risks: Sanders could avoid the specific keyword or the event format could limit political references.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: YES**

I checked whether the determining event (the Sanders/Khanna Stanford townhall) has already happened and whether it will be publicly verifiable. The event is scheduled for **Friday, Feb 20, 2026** and is described as a *private* Stanford-affiliates-only townhall, with a **media policy restricting recording to pre-approved media**, which creates a credible path where the keyword might be said but **not captured by the resolution-eligible sources**. The Stanford Speakers Bureau page does list “Watch the livestream” with YouTube/Instagram links, so it may still be broadcast, but the private/recording-restricted format makes “unobservable / insufficiently documented” a real showstopper for a keyword-mention contract.

Showstopper risk exists if the townhall is not actually livestreamed (or the stream lacks usable audio/transcript), because settlement could default to **NO** even if “Trump” is said.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: YES (confidence: LOW). Research flags a credible documentation/observability risk due to the private, recording-restricted townhall format, which could cause settlement to default NO even if the keyword is said.
