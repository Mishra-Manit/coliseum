# Will Trump say "Marijuana / Weed / Cannabis" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Marijuana / Weed / Cannabis

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED (for NO): The market is priced at NO 95¢ (YES 6¢), indicating traders collectively assign a very low probability that Donald Trump will say “Marijuana / Weed / Cannabis” before the Feb 23, 2026 cutoff. Supporting evidence: This is a tightly scoped, objectively checkable mention proposition with a short time window to expiry (closes 2026-02-23 15:00 UTC), and there is no known formal appeals/review process that would overturn a correctly verified transcript/recording outcome. Resolution source: Kalshi resolves per its published market rules and designated source(s)/record(s) for determining whether the specified words were said within the defined window. Risk checklist: clear resolution authority ✓; no formal challenges/appeals pathway affecting outcome ✓; stable inputs (only whether the words are spoken, not a volatile external metric) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-reversal-risk available candidate in this dataset). Remaining risks: Potential ambiguity about what recordings/transcripts count or stream/source discrepancies; mitigate by verifying the exact Kalshi rules/source for this market before sizing.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: YES**

I searched for (1) whether Trump has already said “marijuana/weed/cannabis” within the market’s “before Feb 23, 2026” window, and (2) whether Kalshi “mention” markets have any credible resolution/appeal ambiguity that could override clear audio/transcript evidence. A publicly posted transcript dated **December 18, 2025** records Trump explicitly saying “**marijuana**” multiple times and also “**cannabis**” during an executive-order signing event. citeturn1search0 A White House fact sheet the same day repeatedly uses “medical **marijuana**,” reinforcing that the term was in official communications tied to that event. citeturn1search3

If Kalshi’s market window includes that date and its sourcing recognizes the underlying audio/transcript, then the outcome should be effectively locked to **YES**, making the current 95¢ NO price potentially based on bad/incorrect information (i.e., traders assuming he would not say it). The only remaining “showstopper” would be a market rule that *excludes* that event/source or restricts qualifying utterances (platform-specific “mention” rules can be narrower in some contexts). citeturn0search6turn0search3

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: YES → confidence LOW. The research cites a Dec 18, 2025 transcript/fact sheet indicating Trump already said “marijuana/cannabis,” meaning resolution could flip depending on Kalshi’s exact eligible sources/rules.
