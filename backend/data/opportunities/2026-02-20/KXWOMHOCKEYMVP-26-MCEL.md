# Who will win MVP?

**Outcome**: Macklin Celebrini

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: FORCED_FALLBACK — STRONGLY FAVORED (but not confirmable from reliable sources within budget/time): Market is pricing NO at ~94¢ (implied ~94% that Macklin Celebrini will NOT win), consistent with a longshot single-player MVP outcome in a multi-candidate award market with no structural lock. Supporting Evidence: contract pricing (YES ask 7¢ / NO ask 94¢) indicates near-decided consensus, but this is not an official result and award outcomes can change abruptly. Resolution Source: per Kalshi, each market’s rules page specifies the verification source/authority used for outcome determination (must be checked in full rules before trading). Risk Checklist: clear resolution source identifiable via Kalshi market rules ✓; no formal appeals applicable to this award context ✓ (award decision risk remains). Risk Level: MODERATE (selected as the single least-risky available after filtering out banned categories and previously-discovered tickers; other candidates were higher swing-risk (sports race winners) or had verification ambiguity (speech/mention markets) or were banned (weather/crypto)). Remaining Risks: award/MVP selection criteria and timing may introduce uncertainty until officially announced.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

Searched for (1) the current status of the 2025–26 NHL MVP/Hart Trophy race and whether a winner has already been officially announced, and (2) the official/typical resolution authority for the Hart Trophy and timing of announcements. I found only *mid-season/odds* and “trophy tracker” style coverage listing Nathan MacKinnon as the leading favorite and Macklin Celebrini as a contender, but nothing indicating the Hart Trophy winner has been decided/announced yet (and awards are typically revealed well after the regular season). citeturn0search1turn0search2turn1search4

Given the market closes **Feb 23, 2026**, the determining event (PHWA voting + official announcement of the Hart Trophy winner) appears **not yet occurred**, so there is no “post-result reversal” dynamic to worry about—just normal pre-announcement uncertainty.

No credible showstopper evidence of an official reversal/appeal, cancellation, or “bad-info corrected” scenario was found; the only way the outcome flips is the straightforward one: Celebrini could still win if/when the Hart Trophy is awarded.
