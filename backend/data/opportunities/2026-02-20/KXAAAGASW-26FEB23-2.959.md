# Will average gas prices be above $2.959?

**Outcome**: Above $2.959

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: FORCED_FALLBACK — CONFIRMED/NEAR-DECIDED could not be verified within this scan because no official outcome evidence or appeal status was provided in the prefetched dataset. Supporting Evidence: market pricing implies ~96% for NO (no_ask=96¢) and tight spread (1¢), suggesting traders view ‘above $2.959’ as unlikely as of Feb 20, 2026. Resolution Source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules using an official gas price benchmark (AAA / EIA-style weekly average); exact benchmark not verifiable here. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source identified (Kalshi rules) ✓; no formal challenges could be checked (insufficient evidence) ✗. Risk Level: MODERATE (selected as lowest-risk available given dataset; many other markets are banned categories like weather/crypto or are inherently high-variance sports/word-said props). Remaining Risks: Benchmark definition/timing per Kalshi rules and potential data revisions. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked whether the *determinant* for this market (the official “average gas price” figure Kalshi uses at/after market close on **Feb 23, 2026 04:59 UTC**) is still pending or could be reversed. Current publicly available benchmarks near Feb 2026 show U.S. averages **below $2.959**, including AAA’s national average around **$2.89** in early February 2026 and government/published statistics showing January 2026 regular gasoline around **$2.81**. Separately, EIA’s weekly U.S. retail gasoline series shows early-February 2026 values around **$2.995–$3.033** for an “all grades/all formulations” measure, which highlights that *definition/series choice* matters—but this is a rules-definition risk, not a post-event “flip” mechanism.

No evidence surfaced of an announced cancellation, an official appeal, or a confirmed correction to the benchmark data that would force a complete reversal. The only credible showstopper would be if Kalshi’s rule specifies an EIA weekly series that is **already** above $2.959 for the relevant date/time; I could not verify the exact Kalshi rule text for this specific strike/contract.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research found no pending/appeal/correction mechanism likely to reverse the determinant; remaining issues are rules/benchmark-definition ambiguity rather than a post-event flip.
