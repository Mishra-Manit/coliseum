# LSU vs Indiana winner?

**Outcome**: LSU

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: LSU YES is priced at 94¢ (implied ~94%) with Indiana NO at 8¢, indicating the market strongly expects LSU to win. Supporting Evidence: This is a single-game winner market with a clear binary outcome at game end (winner by final score), and it closes within 72 hours (Feb 22, 2026 19:00 UTC). Resolution Source: The game’s official result as recorded by the NCAA/official game stats for LSU vs Indiana determines the winner (final score). Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; stable inputs (single scheduled game with standard rules) ✓; no formal challenges/appeals expected for a normal regular-season/college game outcome ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate in this dataset; other 92–96% markets here are either weather/crypto (banned) or subjective “mention”/speech-word props with higher adjudication ambiguity). Remaining Risks: Minor—pre-game sports variance (upset risk) remains, but no post-result appeal path typically affects who won the game.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked whether the **determining event is still pending** and whether there’s any **credible cancellation/postponement/rescheduling** risk that could invalidate a near-certain “LSU wins” assumption before the market closes (2026-02-22 19:00 UTC). Multiple official/event sources confirm LSU vs Indiana is scheduled for **Friday, Feb. 20, 2026 at 2:00 PM ET** at VyStar Ballpark as part of the Live Like Lou Jax Classic. citeturn0search2turn0search6turn0search0turn0search1 With the game imminent and a standard “winner by final score” setup, there is no apparent structural path for a completed game result to be reversed.

I also looked for **showstopper reversal mechanisms** (formal appeals, official result disputes, or confirmed rule changes affecting settlement). I found no reporting indicating this specific LSU–Indiana game is canceled, under protest, or subject to an official appeal. The only adjacent risk is platform-level settlement controversy in other markets (e.g., anecdotal user complaints about rule interpretation/changes), but nothing indicates a confirmed, pending reversal impacting this market specifically. citeturn1search0turn1reddit13 

**Conclusion:** No credible showstopper “complete flip” risk is evident; the main uncertainty is simply that the game outcome has not happened yet.
