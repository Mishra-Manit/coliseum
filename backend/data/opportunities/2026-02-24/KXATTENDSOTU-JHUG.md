# Will Jack Hughes attend the 2026 State of the Union Address?

**Outcome**: Jack Hughes

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: The market is priced at ~96% YES (Yes ask 96¢) for Jack Hughes attending the 2026 State of the Union, with the event scheduled for Tuesday, February 24, 2026 at 9:00 p.m. ET—resolution is imminent and attendance outcomes are typically verifiable immediately after the joint session begins/guest seating is observed. Supporting evidence: The close time (2026-02-25T15:00:00Z) is within 48 hours and pricing implies a 4% residual uncertainty, consistent with last-minute travel/security changes rather than substantive reversals. Resolution source: Public, authoritative coverage of the address (pool reports / live broadcast) and the White House’s official SOTU page as the central reference point for the event. Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; recent corroboration of event timing from credible outlets ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable to an attendance fact pattern ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single least-risky available non-banned market). Remaining risks: last-minute non-attendance due to illness, security, or schedule changes.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) whether the **2026 State of the Union is definitely happening on Feb 24, 2026 at 9:00pm ET**, and (2) whether there is **credible, named evidence that Jack Hughes is actually slated to attend** (invitation/acceptance, travel plan), plus (3) any reporting that the plan was **canceled, reversed, or still uncertain**. Multiple mainstream guides confirm the address timing (Feb 24, 9pm ET). Sources specifically about Hughes indicate Trump invited the U.S. men’s hockey team (including Hughes) to attend and that players signaled acceptance/intent to go, but these reports also acknowledge uncertainty about final attendance.

No source I checked indicates the SOTU was canceled/postponed, nor is there any “appeal/reversal” mechanism for an attendance market. The only credible full-flip risk would be a last-minute non-attendance (logistics/security/illness) despite the invitation—i.e., the determining event (his physical presence) is not locked until the joint session occurs.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → proceed with HIGH confidence. Research notes only residual last-minute non-attendance risks (illness/security/logistics), but no evidence of cancellation/reversal or any mechanism that would flip the outcome absent a true no-show.
