# Will Trump say "Bibi / Netanyahu" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Bibi / Netanyahu

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: The market implies a low chance (YES ask 8%) that Trump says “Bibi / Netanyahu” before the Feb 23, 2026 15:00 UTC deadline, making NO the favored side at ~93%. Supporting evidence: This is a short-fuse speech/utterance prop with no structural pathway to ‘appeal’ or ‘recount’; resolution is based on whether the phrase is said on record before the cutoff time. Resolution source: Kalshi rules/market resolver (platform determination using published transcripts/video records). Risk checklist: no formal challenges ✓ (objective utterance, no appeals process), clear resolution source ✓ (Kalshi per market rules), stable inputs ✓ (binary occurrence by a fixed deadline). Risk level: LOW (selected as lowest-risk available non-banned market in this dataset; weather/crypto/parlay markets excluded; NASCAR winner markets are high-variance). Remaining risks: Minor ambiguity over what exact phrasing counts (nickname vs full name) or incomplete transcript coverage before close. Sources: https://kalshi.com/

|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → Confidence: HIGH. Research describes an objective utterance-by-deadline with Kalshi as the resolver; only minor phrasing/transcript-coverage ambiguity is noted, not a structural flip risk.
