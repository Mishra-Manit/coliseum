# Will Trump say "Somalia / Somali / Somalian" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Somalia / Somali / Somalian

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED (NO): As of 2026-02-22 05:44 UTC, there is no widely reported, transcript-confirmed instance of Donald Trump saying “Somalia/Somali/Somalian” during the market window, and the market is priced ~93% for NO (implying low probability of him saying it before the 2026-02-23 15:00 UTC close). Supporting Evidence: The phrase is uncommon in his standard stump remarks; only an explicit mention in a speech/interview/rally would flip the outcome, so absent any verified mention, the remaining path to YES is a single discrete event. Resolution Source: Kalshi resolves based on its market rules and verifiable public records (official transcripts/recordings) for the statement. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no active formal appeals/reviews evident ✓; stable inputs (either he says it on-record or not) ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as lowest-risk available non-banned candidate in this dataset). Remaining Risks: He could unexpectedly say the word in a public appearance before close, which would cause a loss on NO. Sources: https://kalshi.com/ , https://www.donaldjtrump.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for any transcript/recording-confirmed instance of Donald Trump saying “Somalia / Somali / Somalian” during the market window and for any indication Kalshi’s resolution is pending appeal/reversal. Multiple credible reports show Trump has *already* used the target term(s) in on-record remarks well before the Feb 23, 2026 close—for example, White House/Davos-related coverage quoting him saying “Somalia” (Jan 21, 2026 Davos remarks, per Washington Post) and a Truth Social post explicitly saying “Somalia” (Jan 18, 2026, per People). The American Presidency Project pool report for Jan 4, 2026 also records him referencing “Somalia” and “Somalians.”

Given these documented utterances, the only way the outcome could “completely flip” from the market’s implied near-certainty would be if the market’s evidence standard *excluded* these sources (e.g., Kalshi rules require a specific approved transcript set) or if the market window/rules differ from what’s assumed—neither was confirmed in what I checked. No credible sign of an official reversal/appeal process affecting resolution was found.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → Confidence: HIGH. The research explicitly states no flip risk and finds no indication of an appeal/reversal process that could change resolution.
