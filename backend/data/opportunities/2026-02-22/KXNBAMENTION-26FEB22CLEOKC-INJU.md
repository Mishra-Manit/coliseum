# What will the announcers say during Cleveland vs Oklahoma City Professional Basketball Game?

**Outcome**: Injury / Injured

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This market is priced at YES 96% (NO 7%) in the provided order book, indicating the market strongly expects the broadcast to include an “injury/injured” mention. Supporting evidence: within-hours settlement window (closes 2026-02-22 23:00 UTC) and very tight spread suggests stable consensus at the 92–96% band. Resolution source: Kalshi’s market resolution for the specific “announcers say” ruleset for this event. Risk checklist: clear resolution source (Kalshi rules) ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable for a transcript-style sports mention market ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as lowest-risk available non-banned market in this dataset). Remaining risks: wording/coverage risk (broadcast may not include the exact tracked phrase) and reliance on Kalshi’s specific phrase-matching rules. Sources: https://kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) the exact market resolution rules for the “announcers say” contract and (2) whether the Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game on **Feb 22, 2026** is scheduled/televised as expected (since cancellation or a non-counting broadcast could be a showstopper). The contract language indicates the market resolves **Yes** if the play-by-play or color commentator says the exact word **“injury”** or **“injured”** (including plural/possessive), with resolution primarily by **video**, then transcripts if needed; counting runs from tipoff through end of game and is based on the **national broadcast (ABC)** if nationally televised. citeturn0search0

Multiple game-preview/injury-report pages list the matchup as occurring **Sunday, Feb 22, 2026 at 1:00 PM ET** and explicitly note **TV: ABC**, plus several players on injury reports—conditions that make an “injury/injured” mention very likely but, more importantly here, show the event is not obviously canceled or already completed. citeturn0search3turn0search1

No sources indicated a confirmed pending appeal/reversal mechanism or that the determining event (broadcast commentary) is already finalized differently. The only meaningful non-flip risk is wording/exact-match nuance, but that would not constitute a “complete reversal” catalyst.
