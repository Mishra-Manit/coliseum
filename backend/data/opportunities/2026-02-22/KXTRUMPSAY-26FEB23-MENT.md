# Will Trump say "Mental Institution" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Mental Institution

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED (NO): As of 2026-02-22 (UTC), this is a tight-defined phrase-trigger market with NO priced at ~0.93, implying the market expects he will NOT say the exact phrase before the Feb 23, 2026 15:00 UTC cutoff; the short time window (≈33 hours from scan time) further limits the number of public speaking opportunities. Supporting evidence: contract is phrase-specific (exact words) and the market is already pricing NO at 93¢ (YES ask 8¢ / NO ask 93¢), indicating a near-sure outcome under Kalshi’s rules for exact-phrase occurrence within the window. Resolution source: Kalshi per its market rules and designated resolution method (publicly available transcripts/recordings as specified by Kalshi). Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal appeals/reviews applicable ✓; stable inputs (binary phrase occurrence) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-reversal-risk available candidate in this dataset, given all non-banned alternatives here are more outcome-volatile like race winners). Remaining risks: unexpected public remark using the exact phrase before close. Sources: https://www.kalshi.com/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I researched whether the determining event (Trump publicly saying the exact phrase **“Mental Institution”**) is still pending before the market cutoff (Feb 23, 2026 15:00 UTC), and whether there’s any credible mechanism for the already-priced outcome to later reverse (e.g., confirmed appeals/reversals, or bad-info correction). I also checked recent primary-source-style transcript repositories to see if the exact phrase has already occurred recently (which would be the main way the market could “flip” toward YES).

What I found: there’s no indication of any **pending official appeal/reversal process** relevant to a phrase-trigger market—resolution is purely evidentiary (did he say the exact words in a qualifying public context by the deadline). Recent transcript material shows Trump has used similar language (“mental institutions”) in January 2026 (CNN transcript), but that is **not** the exact phrase “Mental Institution,” and it’s outside the market’s narrow trigger. Therefore, the only credible showstopper is the event itself occurring before the cutoff; nothing suggests an administrative or informational reversal risk.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → confidence HIGH. Research indicates no appeal/reversal mechanism for this phrase-trigger market; only remaining risk is the phrase being said before cutoff.
