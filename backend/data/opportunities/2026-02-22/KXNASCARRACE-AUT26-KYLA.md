# Will Kyle Larson be the Autotrader 400 Winner?

**Outcome**: Kyle Larson

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: FORCED_FALLBACK — STRONGLY FAVORED (market-implied): NO is priced at 96% (YES ask 5%, NO ask 96%), but the race winner is inherently uncertain until the checkered flag; no quantitative structural lock is available from the provided dataset alone. Supporting Evidence: Only market data supports the selection (tight 1¢ spread; large volume/open interest), with no official race result yet and no remaining-ballots-style lock; this is selected solely because all non-banned markets in the universe are similar NASCAR winner props and this one offers the highest implied probability in-range. Resolution Source: NASCAR’s official race result/standings (final classification) determines the winner at resolution. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal appeals found (not assessed due to no web research) ✗; strong position (96% implied) ✓. Risk Level: HIGH (FORCED_FALLBACK) — selected as the single least-risky available market under the dataset constraints. Remaining Risks: Late-race incidents, strategy swings, cautions, or scoring review could change outcome. Sources: https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: YES**

I checked whether the determining event (the 2026 Autotrader 400 race result) has already occurred and whether NASCAR has published an official final classification. NASCAR’s own live-results page for the “2026 Autotrader 400” currently shows “STARTING SOON!” and “Live updates will begin displaying closer to the start of the race,” indicating the race is not completed and no official winner is posted yet. citeturn2view0 FOX Sports’ event page also lists the race as scheduled for **Sunday, Feb 22, 2026** (8:00 PM local listing), reinforcing that the outcome is pending rather than finalized. citeturn0search0 

Because the race has not been run to completion (checkered flag not reached / final classification not posted), there is an inherent full-reversal risk: any driver, including Kyle Larson, could still win on-track. No “appeal/reversal” issue is needed—this is simply unresolved.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: YES (the race has not been completed and no official final classification is posted), so confidence is LOW and this is not a locked outcome.
