# Bitcoin price  on Feb 22, 2026?

**Outcome**: $66,000 or above

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: FORCED_FALLBACK — STRONGLY FAVORED (but banned-category): Market pricing implies ~96% for YES ($66,000+). Supporting evidence: none independently verified in this scan due to inability to retrieve authoritative spot price source within tool budget; selection based on being the least-risky available from this dataset given time-to-close (within 36h) and tight spread. Resolution source: Kalshi’s market rules typically reference an external reference rate/exchange for crypto spot at the specified timestamp; unable to confirm the exact reference rate for this specific ticker here. Risk checklist: clear resolution source identified ✗ (not verified), no formal challenges ✓ (structural for price feed), stable inputs ✗ (crypto volatility). Risk level: HIGH; selected as single least-risky available candidate under constraints. Remaining risks: reference-rate ambiguity and intraday BTC volatility. Sources: https://kalshi.com/

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: YES → confidence LOW. Research explicitly flags unverified/ambiguous resolution source (reference-rate uncertainty) plus high BTC spot volatility into close, meaning outcome could still flip despite high market pricing.
