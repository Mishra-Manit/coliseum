# Will Trump say "Thug" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Thug

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: With the market closing on Feb 23, 2026 at 15:00 UTC, the NO side is priced ~95%, implying the market expects Trump will not say the exact keyword in the remaining window; this is a short-fuse, binary keyword event with limited remaining time. Supporting Evidence: The only way for YES to win is a verifiable public utterance of the exact word/phrase before the deadline; absent a scheduled major Trump appearance in the remaining hours, the base rate for a specific word being said is low, consistent with the market’s 94–95% NO pricing. Resolution Source: Per Kalshi’s market life cycle/rules framework, markets resolve based on predefined contract criteria and a specified source agency/data source in the market’s Rules summary. Risk Checklist: clear resolution source identified ✓; no formal appeals/judicial reviews applicable ✓; stable inputs (either he says it publicly or not) ✓. Risk Level: LOW (selected as lowest-reversal-risk available among non-banned categories, given other non-banned options here are NASCAR race-winner and Billboard chart outcomes which have higher inherent volatility/measurement uncertainty). Remaining Risks: A late, widely covered Trump remark containing the keyword before the cutoff. Sources: https://news.kalshi.com/p/what-is-the-market-life-cycle

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I checked for any evidence that the determining event is still “in progress,” could be officially reversed, or was priced on bad/changed information. Web results did **not** show a confirmed Trump utterance of the exact word **“thug”** in the current window, nor any reliable “already happened” reporting that would imply the market is mispriced. I also looked for imminent high-profile Trump speaking opportunities before the market’s cutoff (2026-02-23 15:00 UTC); the most prominent upcoming appearance in this period appears to be the **State of the Union on Feb 24, 2026**, which is **after** the cutoff, so it wouldn’t count anyway. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_State_of_the_Union_Address?utm_source=openai))

The only credible way for a complete flip would be (a) Trump saying “thug” publicly before the deadline in a clearly documentable way, or (b) the contract’s resolution criteria/source being different than assumed (e.g., a narrow transcript-only rule). I did not find the specific Kalshi rules page for this exact ticker in search results, so I cannot confirm any unusual settlement mechanics from primary docs.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → proceed with HIGH confidence. Research found no evidence the keyword was already said within the window and no credible reversal mechanics beyond an unforeseen pre-deadline public utterance or unusual contract rules.
