# Will Trump say "Who are you with / Where are you from" before Feb 23, 2026?

**Outcome**: Who are you with / Where are you from

## Scout Assessment

**Rationale**: STRONGLY FAVORED: This is a short-horizon speech/phrase-prop with NO priced at 95% (YES ask 6¢, NO ask 95¢), implying the market expects Trump will NOT say the exact quoted phrase before market close (Feb 23, 2026 15:00 UTC). Supporting evidence: the contract is a very specific uncommon phrasing; absent a scheduled appearance where this exact line is likely, the base rate for the exact match over ~1 day is low; current order book already prices NO as the dominant outcome (94–95 bid/ask). Resolution source: Kalshi resolves per its market rules using publicly available recordings/transcripts of Trump’s public remarks within the window. Risk checklist: clear resolution source ✓; no formal challenges/appeals path typical for this type of market ✓; stable inputs (only depends on whether the phrase is spoken) ✓. Risk level: LOW (selected as the single lowest-risk available candidate after excluding banned weather and crypto price markets and avoiding multi-outcome sports winner props). Remaining risks: An unscheduled remark (rally/interview) could include the phrase or close paraphrase depending on Kalshi’s exact matching rules.

## Research Synthesis

**Flip Risk: NO**

I searched for (1) the specific Kalshi market/rules for this strike to see if resolution is based on an objective transcript/video standard and whether an appeal/reversal pathway is pending, and (2) any evidence Trump has already said the exact phrase *"Who are you with"* or *"Where are you from"* in the current window (Feb 22–23, 2026) via recent coverage/transcripts/summaries.

I did **not** find credible reporting that Trump has already uttered the exact quoted strike phrase during Feb 22, 2026 remarks, nor any indication the determining event is already “locked” to YES. Recent mainstream coverage of Trump remarks (e.g., Georgia appearance and Feb 22 news updates) does not surface this exact phrasing. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/19/trump-tariffs-georgia?utm_source=openai))  

The only real showstopper flip scenario would be **an additional public appearance before 2026-02-23 15:00 UTC** where he says the exact words, since the determining event is still pending until the window ends.

## Trade Evaluation

| Side | Edge | EV | Suggested Size |
|------|------|-----|----------------|
| **YES** |  |  |  |
| **NO** |  |  |  |

**Status**: Pending

### Reasoning

Flip Risk: NO → Confidence: HIGH. Research indicates no evidence the phrase has already been said and no identified mechanism for a late resolution flip beyond the ordinary risk of an unscheduled appearance before close.
