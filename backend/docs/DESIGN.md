# Coliseum: Autonomous Quant Agent System

## Specification Document v2.2 (Edge Trading)

---

## Executive Summary

**Coliseum** is an autonomous quantitative trading system that deploys AI agents to trade on Kalshi prediction markets. The system operates as a fully autonomous pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to research events, identify trading opportunities, execute positions, and continuously monitor the portfolio.

### Vision Statement
> *Build a self-sustaining AI trading system that can independently identify market mispricings, capture edge through disciplined entry and exit, and adapt to changing market conditions—all with minimal human intervention.*

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Operation** | Agents run 24/7 with minimal human oversight |
| **Research-Driven** | Every trade is backed by deep, grounded research |
| **Risk-First** | Hard limits and circuit breakers prevent catastrophic losses |
| **Transparent** | Full audit trail of every decision and trade |
| **Edge Capture** | Exit before resolution—capture mispricings, not outcomes |

---

## Trading Strategy

### Edge Trading vs Resolution Trading

Coliseum uses an **Edge Trading** strategy, which differs fundamentally from traditional resolution-based trading:

| Aspect | Resolution Trading | Edge Trading (Coliseum) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Win Condition** | Correctly predict outcome | Identify market mispricing |
| **Exit Trigger** | Event resolves | Market corrects toward true probability |
| **Hold Period** | Until resolution | Maximum 5 days |
| **Risk Profile** | Binary (win/lose at resolution) | Continuous (P&L from price movement) |
| **Variance** | High (100% or 0%) | Lower (capture partial edge) |

### Strategy Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Min Days to Close** | 4 days | Allows time for market to reprice |
| **Max Days to Close** | 10 days | Capital efficiency; avoid long-dated positions |
| **Profit Target** | 70% edge capture | Take profits before full edge realized |
| **Stop Loss** | 10% of position | Tight stops; cut losses quickly |
| **Max Hold Days** | 5 days | Force exit regardless of P&L |
| **Kelly Fraction** | 0.50 (half Kelly) | More aggressive sizing for shorter holds |
| **Min Edge Threshold** | 5% | Only trade significant mispricings |

### Exit Rules

Guardian agent (when implemented) will enforce these exit rules:

1. **Profit Target**: Exit when 70% of identified edge is captured
2. **Stop Loss**: Exit if position loses 10% of entry value
3. **Time Stop**: Exit after 5 days regardless of P&L
4. **Resolution Warning**: Exit 24 hours before event resolution (never hold to expiry)

### Why Edge Trading?

1. **Reduced Variance**: Don't need to be "right" about outcomes, just about mispricings
2. **Capital Efficiency**: Shorter hold times = more trades = more edge capture
3. **Risk Management**: Can cut losses before resolution; not locked into binary outcome
4. **Research Value**: Focus on "what does the market not know?" not "what will happen?"

Guardian ◀──(OpenPosition)─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   │
   └──(ExitSignal)──▶ Trader ──(ClosePosition)──▶ Kalshi
```

**Key Architecture Decision**: All three stages (Scout, Researcher, Recommender) write to a **single opportunity file**, progressively enriching it with new sections and frontmatter fields. This eliminates the need for separate `research/` and `recommendations/` directories and provides a unified audit trail per event.

## Agent Specifications

### 1. Scout Agent 🔍 (IMPLEMENTED)

**Mission**: Discover market mispricings—opportunities where research reveals the true probability differs from the market price.

#### Edge Trading Focus
Scout filters for markets with:
- **4-10 day time horizon**: Enough time for market to reprice, not too far out
- **Mispricing potential**: Research can reveal information asymmetry
- **Repricing catalyst**: Clear reason why market will correct

#### Responsibilities
- Scan Kalshi API for events closing in 4-10 days
- Filter events by liquidity, volume, and time horizon
- Conduct deep web research to identify mispricings
- Create opportunity files with mispricing thesis
- Identify WHY the market will reprice (not just predict outcome)

#### Execution Schedule
- **Market Scan**: Every 60 minutes (comprehensive market sweep)
- Triggered on-demand via CLI: `python -m coliseum scout`

#### Tools Available

| Tool | Purpose | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `fetch_markets_closing_soon` | Fetch events in 4-10 day window | `services/kalshi.py` |
| `WebSearchTool` | Research markets for information asymmetry | OpenAI built-in |
| `generate_opportunity_id_tool` | Create unique opportunity IDs | Built-in logic |
| `get_current_time` | Get current timestamp | Built-in logic |

#### Output Format
Creates opportunity file at `data/opportunities/{ticker}.md` with:
- Mispricing thesis and repricing catalyst
- Market snapshot (prices, volume, liquidity)
- Research findings with sources
- Target exit price and expected edge capture

---

### 2. Analyst Agent 📊 (IMPLEMENTED)

**Mission**: Deeply research opportunities and generate actionable trade recommendations.

The Analyst agent is split into two specialized sub-agents that work sequentially:

#### 2A. Researcher Sub-Agent 🕵️

**Mission**: Conduct comprehensive research on the event and synthesize findings.

##### Responsibilities
- Fetch opportunity details from the stored opportunity file
- Formulate specific research questions for the market
- Use OpenAI's WebSearchTool to gather information from the web
- Synthesize research into a structured markdown report with embedded sources
- Append research section and update frontmatter metadata

##### Tools Available

| Tool | Purpose | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `fetch_opportunity_details` | Load opportunity data (market info, prices, rationale) | `agents/analyst/researcher/main.py` |
| `WebSearchTool()` | Native web search via OpenAI (built-in PydanticAI tool) | PydanticAI framework |

##### Output Format
Appends to opportunity file:
- Research synthesis section (markdown with embedded Sources section)
- Frontmatter updates: `research_completed_at`, `research_duration_seconds`

---

#### 2B. Recommender Sub-Agent ⚖️

**Mission**: Evaluate trading opportunity and compute metrics based on research.

##### Responsibilities
- Calculate edge and expected value using research insights
- Assess trade quality (confidence, uncertainty, opportunity cost)
- Determine position sizing
- Append recommendation section to opportunity file

##### Tools Available

| Tool | Purpose | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `calculate_edge` | Compute market inefficiency | `agents/calculations.py` |
| `calculate_ev` | Expected value calculation | `agents/calculations.py` |
| `kelly_criterion` | Optimal position sizing | `agents/calculations.py` |

##### Output Format
Appends to opportunity file:
- Trade evaluation metrics (edge, EV, estimated probability)
- Position sizing (Kelly fraction, contract quantity)
- Concise reasoning (~100 words)

---

#### Analyst Pipeline Flow

```
Opportunity File (Scout)
         │
         ▼
    Researcher ───(Appends Research)───▶ Opportunity File
         │
         ▼
   Recommender ───(Appends Evaluation)───▶ Opportunity File (Final)
         │
         ▼
    Trader (direct handoff)
```

**See**: [`docs/Research_agent_pipeline.md`](./Research_agent_pipeline.md) for detailed pipeline specification.

---

### 3. Trader Agent 💰 (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

**Mission**: Execute trades with disciplined risk management and slippage protection.

#### Planned Responsibilities
- Validate recommendations against current portfolio state
- Calculate slippage-adjusted edge before execution
- Execute trades using limit orders only (never market orders)
- Use "working order" strategy (place → wait → reprice → cancel after 3 attempts)
- Update portfolio state and create position files
- Log all trades to JSONL ledger

#### Execution
- On-demand (direct handoff from Analyst)
- Triggered by: `python -m coliseum trader --recommendation-id <id>`

#### Order Execution (TODO)

The Trader agent will use limit orders only (never market orders) with slippage protection. Orders will be "worked" (place → wait → reprice) rather than fire-and-forget. See implementation in `agents/trader/` when built.

---

### 4. Guardian Agent 🛡️ (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

**Mission**: Enforce exit discipline for edge trading—capture profits, cut losses, never hold to resolution.

#### Edge Trading Exit Rules
Guardian enforces these exit conditions:

| Exit Type | Trigger | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Profit Target** | 70% of identified edge captured | Close position, lock in gains |
| **Stop Loss** | Position down 10% | Close position, cut losses |
| **Time Stop** | 5 days since entry | Close position regardless of P&L |
| **Resolution Warning** | <24 hours to event close | FORCE close (never hold to expiry) |

#### Planned Responsibilities
- Monitor price movements and calculate edge capture percentage
- Track hold duration against max_hold_days limit
- Watch for resolution approaching (time-to-close warnings)
- Generate exit signals for Trader to execute
- Update position health metrics

#### Execution Schedule (Planned)
- **Position Check**: Every 15 minutes (price monitoring, exit triggers)
- **News Scan**: Every 30 minutes (research invalidation)
- Triggered on-demand: `python -m coliseum guardian --check-positions`

#### Monitoring (TODO)

Position monitoring and exit signal generation will be implemented in `agents/guardian/`. Critical for edge trading strategy—without Guardian, positions could be held to resolution (violating strategy).

## File Storage Structure

### Design Principles

1. **Human-Readable**: All files are Markdown or YAML (no binary formats)
2. **Git-Friendly**: Meaningful diffs, easy to track changes
3. **Auditable**: Every decision has a paper trail
4. **Single Source of Truth**: `state.yaml` contains portfolio state
5. **Progressive Enrichment**: Opportunity files grow as agents process them

### Directory Layout

```
backend/data/
├── config.yaml                 # System configuration (risk limits, agent settings)
├── state.yaml                  # Portfolio state (cash, positions, daily PnL)
├── .env                        # API keys (git-ignored)
│
├── opportunities/              # Market opportunities (Scout → Researcher → Recommender)
│   ├── INXD-25JAN31-B4621.md  # Single file per event (progressive enrichment)
│   └── FEDNXT-25MAR-U75.md
│
├── positions/
│   ├── open/                   # Active positions (updated by Guardian)
│   │   └── INXD-25JAN31-B4621.yaml
│   └── closed/                 # Historical positions (archived on exit)
│       └── FEDNXT-25MAR-U75.yaml
│
└── trades/                     # Trade ledger (append-only JSONL)
    ├── 2025-01-14.jsonl
    └── 2025-01-15.jsonl
```

### Single-File Event Tracking

**Key Design**: All agent outputs for a single event are written to **one opportunity file** that grows progressively:

1. **Scout** creates the file with initial assessment
2. **Researcher** appends research section
3. **Recommender** appends evaluation section

This provides:
- Unified audit trail per opportunity
- Easy human review (one file to read)
- Simplified file management (no cross-referencing needed)
- Git-friendly diffs showing decision evolution

### Key File Formats

#### Example: Opportunity File Progression

## Research Synthesis

Based on comprehensive analysis of S&P 500 historical trends, current economic indicators, and market sentiment:

### Key Facts

- S&P 500 currently at 4,580 (as of Jan 14)
- Target of 4,621 represents +0.9% gain over 17 days
- Historical Jan-Feb average return: +1.2%
- Current volatility: 12.3 (moderate)
- No major earnings reports or Fed meetings until Feb

### Sources

1. **S&P 500 Historical Performance Analysis** (Exa AI)
   - URL: https://example.com/sp500-analysis
   - Key quote: "January historically shows positive returns in 68% of years since 1950"

2. **Real-time Market Sentiment** (Perplexity)
   - Analyst consensus: Neutral to bullish through month-end
   - No major risk events on calendar

### Research Confidence: High

# ... (Scout + Researcher frontmatter preserved)
status: recommendation_complete
recommender_completed_at: 2025-01-14T11:00:00Z
recommendation: BUY_YES

expected_value: 0.18
position_size_pct: 0.025
contract_quantity: 25
---

# ... (Scout + Researcher content preserved)

## Trade Evaluation

**Recommendation**: BUY YES (25 contracts)

### Reasoning

Market is pricing 58% probability, but research suggests 70% chance of S&P reaching 4,621:
- Historical patterns favor January gains
- Current momentum is positive (+1.8% YTD)
- No major risk events on calendar
- Volatility is moderate and stable

**True Probability Estimate**: 70%
**Market Implied Probability**: 58%
**Edge**: +12 percentage points

### Position Sizing

- **Edge**: 12%
- **Expected Value**: +18%
- **Kelly Fraction**: 1/4 Kelly = 2.5% of portfolio
- **Contract Quantity**: 25 contracts ($14.50 cost basis)
- **Max Loss**: $14.50 (if S&P fails to reach target)
- **Max Gain**: $10.50 (if S&P reaches 4,621)

### Risk Assessment

- Within position size limits (2.5% < 10% max)
- Positive expected value (+18%)
- Acceptable liquidity for entry/exit
- **APPROVED FOR TRADING**
```

## Risk Management Framework

### Hard Limits (Circuit Breakers)

These limits are **never bypassed** under any circumstances:

| Limit | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Max Position Size** | 10% of portfolio | Reject trade immediately |
| **Max Single Trade** | $1,000 | Reject trade immediately |
| **Max Open Positions** | 10 concurrent | Reject trade until position closes |
| **Daily Loss Limit** | 10% of portfolio | Halt all trading for 24 hours |
| **Min Edge Threshold** | 5% | Skip trade (insufficient edge) |
| **Min EV Threshold** | 5% | Skip trade (insufficient expected value) |

### Edge Trading Exit Rules

| Rule | Threshold | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Profit Target** | 70% edge capture | Lock in gains before market overshoots |
| **Stop Loss** | 10% position loss | Tight stops for edge trading |
| **Max Hold Time** | 5 days | Force exit; capital efficiency |
| **Resolution Buffer** | Exit 24h before close | NEVER hold to resolution |

### Position-Level Rules

| Rule | Logic | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Slippage Protection** | Reject if slippage destroys 50%+ of edge | Preserve profitable trades only |
| **Liquidity Check** | Require 5x position size in open interest | Ensure ability to exit |
| **Time Stop** | Exit after max_hold_days regardless of P&L | Force capital turnover |
| **Resolution Warning** | Alert at 48h, force exit at 24h | Never hold to binary outcome |

### Trading Calculations

All position sizing uses Kelly Criterion (1/2 Kelly for edge trading). See [`calculations.md`](./calculations.md) for mathematical foundations including:
- Edge calculation
- Expected value (EV) calculation
- Kelly Criterion formula
- Slippage-adjusted sizing

---

## File Operations

All file operations use atomic writes (tempfile + rename) to prevent corruption. See `coliseum/storage/` for implementation:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `state.py` | Portfolio state management (read/write `state.yaml`) |
| `files.py` | Opportunity and position file operations |
| `queue.py` | Analyst queue helpers (TODO: not yet implemented) |

---

## Scheduler & Execution

### Scheduled Jobs

| Job | Frequency | Status |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Scout market scan | Every 60 min | ✅ Implemented |
| Guardian position check | Every 15 min | ❌ Not implemented |
| Guardian news scan | Every 30 min | ❌ Not implemented |

Implementation: `coliseum/scheduler.py` using APScheduler.

---

## Telegram Alerts (TODO: Not Yet Implemented)

Real-time notifications for trades, position changes, and risk events will be sent directly via Telegram Bot API (no local file storage). See `services/telegram.py` stub for future implementation.

Planned alert types:
- Trade executed
- Position opened/closed
- Circuit breaker triggered
- Daily P&L summary

**Note**: Alerts are sent directly via Telegram and are not persisted to local files.

---

## Observability & Monitoring

### Logfire Integration

All agent runs are automatically traced using Pydantic Logfire, providing:
- LLM call latency and token usage
- Agent decision trees
- Tool execution traces
- Error tracking

Configuration: Set `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in `.env`

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Win Rate** | % of profitable trades |
| **Average Edge** | Mean edge across all trades |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted returns |
| **Max Drawdown** | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| **Daily P&L** | Track against loss limits |

---

## Implementation Phases
---

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Core infrastructure—agents can run, Kalshi API works, files persist.
